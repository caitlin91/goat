abstract = {For a century, phoneticians have noted a vowel merger in middle-class Scottish English, in the neutralisation of prerhotic checked vowels /I{\{}small{\}}/, /v{\{}inverted{\}}/, /e{\{}open{\}}/ to a central vowel, e.g. fir, fur, fern [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}] [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}n], or [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}n]. Working-class speakers often neutralise two of these checked vowels to a low back [v{\{}inverted{\}}] vowel, fir, fur, both pronounced as [fv{\{}inverted{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}] or as [fv{\{}inverted{\}}{\{}glottal stop, reversed{\}}]. The middle-class merger is often assumed to be an adaptation towards the UK's socially prestigious R.P. phonological system in which there is a long-standing three-way non-rhotic merger, to [e{\{}reversed, open{\}}:]. However, we suggest a system-internal cause, that coarticulation with the postvocalic /r/ may play a role in the contemporary Scottish vowel merger. Indeed, strongly rhotic middle-class Scottish speakers have recently been found to produce postvocalic approximant /r/ using a markedly different tongue configuration from working-class Scottish speakers, who also tend to derhoticise /r/. We present the results of an ultrasound tongue imaging investigation into the differing coarticulatory effects of bunched and tongue-front raised /r/ variants on preceding vowels. We compare tongue shapes from two static points during rhotic syllable rimes. Phonetically, it appears that the bunched /r/ used by middle-class speakers exerts a stronger global coarticulatory force over preceding vowel tongue configurations than tongue-front raised /r/ does. This also results in a monophthongal rhotic target for what historically had been three distinct checked vowels. Phonologically, our view is that middle-class speakers of Scottish English have reduced the V+/r/ sequence to one segment; either a rhoticised vowel /e{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}/ or a syllabic rhotic /r/. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study describes the frequencies of the first two formants of monophthongs produced by male RP speakers in four age groups: aged 20–25, 35–40, 50–55, and 65–73 years in 2001. The eleven monophthongs were spoken in /hVd/ contexts by five men in each age group. The eleven words, together with nineteen filler words chosen to distract attention from the purpose of the experiment, were randomized four times and read by each speaker in citation form, for a total of 880 items. F1 and F2 frequencies were measured in Hz and ERB-rate. As expected, in younger compared with older speakers, F1 is higher in /E/ and especially /oe/, and F2 is higher in /u{\ldots}/ and /U/. Other vowels varied in overall dispersion of F1 or F2, but no other differences between age groups were observed. There is evidence that the oldest age group to show change in a vowel's quality has particularly large differences between individuals, so that, collectively, members of that group span much of the quality range from 'conservative' (older groups) to 'progressive' (younger groups). Such so-called 'break groups' have implications for theoretical explanations of sound change.},

@article{Hinton2015,
abstract = {This paper sets out to investigate changes and individual irregularities in the Received Pronunciation of a number of individuals over time and to compare them with the changes noted in contemporary RP in the literature. The aim of the study is to ascertain whether accent change affects individuals during their lifetimes or is only brought about by new generations of speakers accepting different pronunciations as the norm and effectively speaking with a different accent to older generations within their social circle. The variations/changes looked for were: CLOTH transfer, CURE lowering, GOAT allophony, R-sandhi, and T-voicing. The procedure of the study was to identify the presence or absence of these features in the speech of certain individuals in recordings made over a period of at least 35 years. The individuals studied were: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Baroness Thatcher, Sir David Attenborough and David Dimbleby. The results of these comparisons suggest that individual speakers are not greatly affected by changes in pronunciation taking place around them and generally stay with the preferred pronunciation of their youth. There are, however, cases where a general uncertainty amongst speakers of the accent, here found in CURE lowering, does influence the speech of individuals over time.},

@article{Roach2004,
abstract = {The accent described here is the present-day version of the accent that has been used as the standard in phoneticians' description of the pronunciation of British English for centuries. The definition of this accent is a matter of heated debate and frequent controversy: the arguments will not be rehearsed here, but the interested reader is recommended to look at Jones (1917 and subsequent) and Wells (2000). The most important aspects of this accent should, however, be made clear: a. The number of native speakers of this accent who originate in Ireland, Scotland and Wales is very small and probably diminishing, and it is therefore a misnomer to call it an accent of BRITISH English. It is an accent spoken by some English people. b. The great majority of native speakers of this accent are of middle-class or upper-class origin, educated at private schools and (if of appropriate age) university. This does not mean that the accent cannot be acquired by others: the present author (who attended a state school in the Midlands) originally spoke with an accent with noticeable regional features, but has over many years of teaching the phonetics of English acquired an accent not far from the standard one described here. c. The majority of speakers of this accent live in, or originate from, the south-east of England. d. The accent is most familiar as that used by most 'official' BBC speakers of English origin (newsreaders and announcers on Radio 4 and Radio 3, and most television channels). It is also frequently heard on the BBC World Service, though that service appears to have adopted the policy of sometimes using newsreaders and announcers with noticeable foreign accents. It is clear that this accent will eventually lose its pre-eminent status in broadcasting as a result of the wish to broaden the social base of broadcast speech, but it will take a long time for this to happen. The accent has been known for nearly a century as RECEIVED PRONUNCIATION, or by its abbreviation, RP. Early in the 20th century, Daniel Jones, the great exponent of the description of English pronunciation, named it PUBLIC SCHOOL PRONUNCIATION (Jones 1917), but later changed the name to Received Pronunciation. Other names have been proposed, such as GENERAL BRITISH (GB) and EDUCATED SOUTHERN BRITISH ENGLISH. The present author's own preference is for the name BBC PRONUNCIATION or BBC ACCENT (Jones, ed. by Roach et al. 2003), but given the continuing popularity of the name Received Pronunciation, this has been used for the description which follows.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyse the extent to which an adult's vowel space is affected by vowel changes to the community using a database of nine Christmas broadcasts made by Queen Elizabeth II spanning three time periods (the 1950's; the late 1960's/early 70's; the 1980's). An analysis of the monophthongal formant space showed that the first formant frequency was generally higher for open vowels, and lower for mid-high vowels in the 1960's and 1980's data than in the 1950's data, which we interpret as an expansion of phonetic height from earlier to later years. The second formant frequency showed a more modest compression in later, compared with earlier years: in general, front vowels had a decreased F2 in later years, while F2 of the back vowels was unchanged except for [u] which had a higher F2 in the 1960's and 1980's data. We also show that the majority of these Fl and F2 changes were in the direction of the vowel positions of 1980's Standard Southern British speakers reported in Deterding (1997). Our general conclusion is that there is evidence of accent change within the same individual over time and that the Queen's vowels in the Christmas broadcasts have shifted in the direction of a more mainstream form of Received Pronunciation.},

abstract = {The present study is concerned with lax /ʊ/-fronting in Standard British English and in particular with whether this sound change in progress can be attributed to a waning of the perceptual compensation for the coarticulatory effects of context. Younger and older speakers produced various monosyllables in which /ʊ/ occurred in different symmetrical consonantal contexts. The same speakers participated in a forced-choice perception experiment in which they categorized a synthetic /ɪ-ʊ/ continuum embedded in fronting /s{\_}t/ and non-fronting /w{\_}l/ contexts. /ʊ/ was shown to be fronted for the younger age group in both production and perception. Although there was no conclusive evidence that younger listeners compensated less for coarticulation than did older listeners, the size of the coarticulatory influence of consonantal context on /ʊ/ in perception was found to be smaller than in production for the younger than for the older group. The findings are consistent with a model of sound change in which the perceptual compensation for coarticulation wanes ahead of changes that take place to coarticulatory relationships in speech production. As a result, the perception and production of coarticulation may be unusually misaligned with respect to each other for some speaker-listeners participating in a sound change in progress. Keywords},

The results, among other things, confirm our hypothesis that the onset of mouth is now decidedly fronter than and does not overlap with the onset of price. Furthermore, we sought to determine the exact extent of goose- fronting, which according to our data is, even in this variety of English, fronter than centre, as well as the quality of the goat glide, which seems to be following suit.},
