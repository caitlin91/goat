abstract = {1. Introduction It almost goes without saying that acceptability judgments form a continuous spectrum. While many sentences are either clearly acceptable or clearly unaccept-able, a significant number of sentences fall somewhere in between in a gray area of partial acceptability. This fact has been explicitly admitted by linguists since at least Chomsky 1965. The working assumption adopted by most linguists over the past 40 years has been that these intermediate levels of acceptability are caused by properties other than grammatical knowledge. Linguists have assumed that grammatical knowledge is categorical — sentences are either grammatical or ungrammatical — and that the continuous spectrum of acceptability is caused by extra-grammatical factors (plausibility, working memory limitations, etc.). Of course, ideas such as strength of violation have been introduced into theories of grammatical knowledge at various times, for instance Huang's (1982) proposal that ECP violations are stronger than Subjacency violations or Chomsky's (1986) proposal that each barrier crossed leads to lower acceptability. However, with the notable exception of Optimality Theory (see especially Keller 2000, 2003), these analyses have been the exception rather than the rule. The past ten years or so have seen a major shift in attitudes toward intermediate levels of acceptability. With the increasing use of formal experimental methods for measuring acceptability — a methodology that has come to be known as experimental syntax — it has become almost trivial to detect subtle differences along a continuous spectrum of acceptability. This new power afforded by experimental syntax raises the question of whether the continuity of acceptability reflects a continuity in grammatical knowledge that should be captured by the theory of grammar, or in other words, whether the working assumption of the past 40 years should be abandoned (see especially Keller 2000, Fanselow et al. 2004). While the answer to this question is ultimately an empirical one that is far from being settled, this report presents two pieces of experimental evidence for a categorical distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. The first is a direct prediction of theories that assume categorical grammaticality. The psychological claim underlying theories of categorical grammaticality is that ungrammatical sentences have no licit representation, or in other words, cannot be constructed from the available mental computations. Grammatical sentences, Biolinguistics  Reports  119 on the other hand, have licit representations that can be constructed from the available mental computations. This predicts that extra-grammatical factors that affect the acceptability and are predicated on the existence of a representation, such as syntactic priming (Luka {\&} Barsalou 2005), should not affect the accepta-bility of ungrammatical sentences. Section 2 presents results from Sprouse (2007) that confirm this prediction: Ungrammatical sentences, in particular island violations (Ross 1967), do not show a structural priming effect. The second piece of evidence comes from the experimental syntax technique magnitude estimation. Unlike traditional tasks such as the yes/no–task and the Likert scale task in which subjects must categorize their responses, magnitude estimation allows subjects to respond using the theoretically infinite continuum of values available on the positive number line (see Bard et al. 1996). By removing the categorization aspect of the task, one might expect that res-ponses would no longer show any categorical distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Contrary to this prediction, section 3 presents evidence from Sprouse (2007) that subjects impose a form of categorization on magnitude estimation responses, and that this categorization appears to correspond with the grammatical/ungrammatical distinction. 2.

@article{Werning2010,
abstract = {What has the self to be like such that introspective awareness of it is possible? The paper asks if Descartes's idea of an inner self can be upheld and discusses this issue by invoking two principles: the phenomenal transparency of experience and the semantic compositionality of conceptual content. It is assumed that self-awareness is a second-order state either in the domain of experience or in the domain of thought. In the former case self-awareness turns out empty if experience is transparent. In the latter, it can best be conceived of as a form of mental quotation. Various proposed analyses of direct and indirect quotation are discussed and tested regarding their applicability to thought. It is concluded that, on the assumption of compositionality, the inner self is only insofar accessible to awareness as it has an accessible phonological (or otherwise subsymbolic) structure, as apparently only inner speech does. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Myers2009,
abstract = {A growing literature argues that native-speaker syntactic judgments are best tested with standard psycholinguistic protocols, but the difficulty of formal experimentation has prevented many syntacticians from trying it. Fortunately, as shown by textual analysis of a typical theoretical syntax paper (Li, 1998), syntacticians already recognize the value of proper experimental designs and quantitative analyses, albeit in nascent forms. Small-scale judgment experiments build on this foundation by applying the minimum amount of extra effort needed to draw valid statistical inferences from the type of data most familiar to syntacticians, namely binary judgments involving very few speakers and sentences. Statistical methods appropriate for such data, some hitherto underused, are described, and software tools for automating small-scale judgment experimentation are introduced. The simplicity and power of the methods are then illustrated in a small-scale test of the claims in Li (1998) on naive Chinese speakers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bader2010,
abstract = {This paper presents three experiments that investigate the relationship between gradient and binary judgments of grammaticality. In the first two experiments, two different groups of participants judged sentences by the method of magnitude esti- mation and by the method of speeded grammaticality judgments in a single session. The two experiments involved identical sentence materials but they differed in the order in which the two procedures were applied. The results show a high correlation between the magnitude estimation data and the speeded grammaticality judgments data, both within a session and across the two sessions. The third experiment was a questionnaire study in which participants judged the same sentences as either gram- matical or ungrammatical without time pressure. This experiment yielded results quite similar to those of the other two experiments. Thus gradient and binary judg- ments both provide valuable and reliable sources for linguistic theory when assessed in an experimentally controlled way. We present a model based on Signal Detection Theory which specifies how gradient grammaticality scores are mapped to binary grammaticality judgments. Finally, we compare our experimental results to existing corpus data in order to inquire into the relationship between grammaticality and frequency of usage},

@article{Siewierska2010,
abstract = {Splittable compounds (SCs) are verbal constructions in Chinese that consist of two parts which are separable by some interposing elements, though they behave like and are usually considered as single words when they are not separated. For many years, SCs in Chinese have presented a challenge to existing morphological and syntactic theories for their morpho-syntactic status. The present study takes a corpus-based approach to the SCs in their interaction with morphology, syntax, and pragmatics, aiming at producing a systematic and realistic account of SCs as attested in 2 million words of authentic spoken and written Chinese data. The results show that the typical grammatical pattern of SCs is constitutive of an aspect marker (-le, -zhe, -guo) or resultative verb complements as post-verbal adjacent elements (54{\%} of all SCs), and a quantifier, a classifier, a modifier or a combination of two or more of them which precede the nominal components of SCs. Drawing on morpho-syntactic and phonological criteria, the split uses, together with their combined uses, of SCs with one inserted aspectual morpheme are viewed as words, while the others are regarded as phrases. From a discourse-pragmatic perspective, the split use of SCs is more often found in the spoken genres of Chinese. Insertions of SCs tend to function as mitigation or modification to the verbal heads or final nominal/complement elements. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},
