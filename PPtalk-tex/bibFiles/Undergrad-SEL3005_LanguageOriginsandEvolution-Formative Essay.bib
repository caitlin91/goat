abstract = {Human beings use at least two fundamentally different forms of communication. One includes language and some other closely related signals, the other most of our nonverbal communication. This second form of communication resembles the communication system of other primates much more closely than it resembles language, and it should be recognized as the primate communication system of the human species. Since our surviving primate communication system remains sharply distinct from language, it is implausible that it could have served as the base from which language evolved. The emergence of language from any earlier primate communication system is equally implausible. Given that language is inseparably bound up with human cognition, the most promising place to look for the antecedents of alnguage is in primate cognitive abilities. We are more likely to find hints about language origins by studying how primates use their minds than by studying how they communicate.},

@article{Tallerman2007,
abstract = {The dominant theory of the evolution of complex language from protolanguage can be termed the synthetic approach. Under this view, single words arose first in evolution, and were combined as syntax evolved. More recently, an alternative scenario for protolanguage has been proposed, which we can term the holistic approach. Scholars subscribing to this view propose that words emerge from longer, entirely arbitrary strings of sounds - non-compositional utterances - via a process of fractionation. Such holistic utterances initially have no internal structure, but represent whole messages. The idea is that over time, chance phonetic similarities are observed between sections of utterances, and that if similar meanings can be ascribed to these strings, then "words" will emerge. This paper dissects the main ideas found in the holistic approach, and argues on a number of grounds that it is conceptually and empirically flawed. A proposal that protolanguage developed out of an earlier holistic primate communication system is hard to sustain, in view of differences between primate vocalization and language. Evidence against the holistic approach is offered on the basis of known facts about the historical development of natural languages, and a conclusion is drawn in favour of synthetic models of protolanguage. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.
