Pronunciation differences between the acrolect and mesolect varieties have also not been examined in much detail, nor has attention been paid to spontaneous speech. This article examines the realisation of consonant clusters and the resyllabification of consonants in BSAE, comparing the acrolect to the mesolect in a transcribed corpus of spontaneous conversation. The major findings are that the mesolect data are subject to more extensive simplification of the distribution of consonants in onset clusters, coda clusters and even singleton codas. Resyllabification of codas also takes place more often in the mesolect, and when resyllabification takes place, intervocalic voicing frequently accompanies it, such that the voicing contrast in intervocalic obstruents is largely neutralised.},

	abstract = {Two general principles of sexual differentiation emerge from previous sociolinguistic studies: that men use a higher frequency of nonstandard forms than women in stable situations, and that women are generally the innovators in linguistic change. It is not clear whether these two tendencies can be unified, or how differences between the sexes can account for the observed patterns of linguistic change. The extensive interaction between sex and other social factors raises the issue as to whether the curvilinear social class pattern associated with linguistic change is the product of a rejection of female-dominated changes by lower-class males. Multivariate analysis of data from the Philadelphia Project on Linguistic Change and Variation indicates that sexual differentiation is independent of social class at the beginning of a change, but that interaction develops gradually as social awareness of the change increases. It is proposed that sexual differentiation of language is generated by two distinct processes: (1) for all social classes, the asymmetric context of language learning leads to an initial acceleration of female-dominated changes and retardation of male-dominated changes; (2) women lead men in the rejection of linguistic changes as they are recognized by the speech community, a differentiation that is maximal for the second highest status group.},

These design features presumably result from self-organizational responses to selection pressures, primarily determined by motor factors.

	abstract = {It is usually assumed that modern language is a recent phenomenon, coinciding with the emergence of modern humans themselves. Many assume as well that this is the result of a single, sudden mutation giving rise to the full "modern package." However, we argue here that recognizably modern language is likely an ancient feature of our genus pre-dating at least the common ancestor of modern humans and Neandertals about half a million years ago. To this end, we adduce a broad range of evidence from linguistics, genetics, paleontology, and archaeology clearly suggesting that Neandertals shared with us something like modern speech and language. This reassessment of the antiquity of modern language, from the usually quoted 50,000-100,000 years to half a million years, has profound consequences for our understanding of our own evolution in general and especially for the sciences of speech and language. As such, it argues against a saltationist scenario for the evolution of language, and toward a gradual process of culture-gene co-evolution extending to the present day. Another consequence is that the present-day linguistic diversity might better reflect the properties of the design space for language and not just the vagaries of history, and could also contain traces of the languages spoken by other human forms such as the Neandertals.},

	abstract = {Most linguistic theories assume lexicon entries which incorporate the idea of the Saussurean sign, a bidirectional mapping between a phonological form and some representation of a concept. This Sign, like grammars generally, is unbiased with respect to perception or production, and provides part of the cognitive map which speakers use both in speaking and in interpreting the utterances of others. This bidirectionality of the Sign, or code, is a design feature of human language although workable communication does not necessarily incorporate such a feature. Part of the Language Acquisition Device is a mechanism which mentally constructs such a biderectional mapping, on the basis of observed samples of communicative behaviour (transmission and reception). This basic aspect of the LAD presumably evolved because of its superiority over other conceivable mechanisms for acquiring a basis for communicative behaviour from a sampling of observed transmission and reception data. Three conceivable strategies for acquiring the basis of communicative behaviour, here labelled the Imitator, Calculator, and Saussurean strategies, are defined as functions from samplings of observed behaviour to acquired behaviour patterns. Essentially, the Imitator imitates the transmission and reception patterns in the observed sample; the Calculator constructs optimal reception responses to the transmissions in the observed sample and optimal transmission responses to receptions in the observed sample; the Saussurean imitates the transmission behaviour in the sample, but shapes his reception behaviour to mirror the acquired transmission behaviour, thus internalizing the equivalent of a set of bidirectional Saussurean signs. Extensive simulations of populations endowed with these innate strategies show the Saussurean strategy to be a winner in evolutionary terms; it produces individuals who communicate more successfully than individuals endowed with the other two strategies.},

The study used an expanded form of the Matched Guise Technique, using recordings collected through sociolinguistic interviews with 8 speakers from North Carolina and California. Excerpts were digitally manipulated to create 32 matched pairs differing only in tokens of (ING), which were used to collect responses in group interviews (N = 55) and a Web-based experiment (N = 124). The alveolar variant -in increased the perceived strength of Southern accents and dampened an accent heard as gay and urban. The influence of (ING) on these accents is linked to shared social meanings of the alveolar form -in and Southern accents on the one hand (lack of education, the country, and the term "redneck") and the velar variant -ing and the gay accent on the other (lowered masculinity, the city, and the term "metrosexual"). These two accents are contrasted with a third variety, heard as nonaccented and aregional. These effects demonstrate the status of the three linguistic objects, the two accents and (ING), as social objects as well.},

A "short" vowel tended to attract consonants to its syllable, as did a stressed vowel. Finally, different syllabifications were produced for clusters like /dr/, which show the typical rise in sonority from the first consonant to the second, and /st/ clusters, which do not. Implications of the results for linguistic theories of syllabification and for studies of the syllable's role in speech perception and reading are discussed. © 1990.},

@phdthesis{Wolf2008,

	title = {Optimal interleaving: serial phonology-morphology interaction in a constraint-based model},
	abstract = {This dissertation proposes a novel theory of the phonology-morphology
interface called Optimal Interleaving (OI). OI is based on Optimality
Theory with Candidate Chains (OT-CC), which is proposed by McCarthy
(2007a) as a serial architecture for Optimality Theory (Prince \&
Smolensky 2004 [1993]). OI adds to OT-CC the hypothesis that morphological
spell-out (Halle \& Marantz 1993's 'vocabulary insertion') occurs
in the phonological component of the grammar. OI thus allows phonological
and morphological operations to be interleaved in a fashion similar
to that assumed in the theory of Lexical Phonology (Kiparsky 1982a,b,
Mohanan 1982). Chapters 2 and 3 argue that OI makes a number of correct
predictions about phonologically-conditioned allomorph selection.
Chiefly, OI derives the empirical generalization that allomorph selection
is always opaque with respect to phonology conditioned by the competing
allomorphs (Paster 2005, 2006, to appear). It does so while keeping
phonologically-driven allomorphy in the phonology and governed by
phonological constraints. OI therefore avoids a version of the Duplication
Problem (Clayton 1976) which is faced by theories which derive the
opacity generalization by attributing all allomorph selection to
subcategorization in the morphology (Paster 2005, 2006, to appear;
Bye 2007). Chapter 4 shows that OI, and more generally OT-CC, can
be applied to non-derived environment blocking (NDEB: Kiparsky 1973a).
It is shown that OI makes five correct predictions about NDEB which
are not collectively predicted by any other theory of this phenomenon.
OI achieves these results without having to make any special assumptions
specific to NDEB. This places OT-CC at a considerable advantage as
a theory of opacity relative to rule-based phonology, where NDEB
requires stipulated restrictions on rule application like the Strict
Cycle Condition (Kean 1974, MascarÃ³ 1976). Chapter 5 shows that
OI also lends itself to the two other main types of serial phonology/morphology
interactions: 'cyclic' overapplication of a process, and underapplication
of a process in a morphologically-derived environment. The chapter
also critiques existing theories of these effects, particularly OO-faithfulness
(Benua 1997), Stratal OT (Kiparsky 2000), and the phonological application
of the theory of phases (Marvin 2002).},

2008. Our results show social stratification of /r/ at the articulatory
level,

with middle-class speakers using bunched articulations, while workingclass

speakers use greater proportions of tongue-tip and tongue-front raised

variants. Unlike articulatory variation of /r/ in American English,
the

articulatory variants in our Scottish English corpus are both auditorily

distinct from one another, and correlate with strong and weak ends
of an

auditory rhotic continuum, which also shows clear social stratification.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.wocn.2013.01.004},
	abstract = {For a century, phoneticians have noted a vowel merger in middle-class Scottish English, in the neutralisation of prerhotic checked vowels /I\{small\}/, /v\{inverted\}/, /e\{open\}/ to a central vowel, e.g. fir, fur, fern [fe\{schwa\}r\{turned\}], [fe\{schwa\}r\{turned\}] [fe\{schwa\}r\{turned\}n], or [fe\{schwa, right hook\}], [fe\{schwa, right hook\}], [fe\{schwa, right hook\}n]. Working-class speakers often neutralise two of these checked vowels to a low back [v\{inverted\}] vowel, fir, fur, both pronounced as [fv\{inverted\}r\{turned\}] or as [fv\{inverted\}\{glottal stop, reversed\}]. The middle-class merger is often assumed to be an adaptation towards the UK's socially prestigious R.P. phonological system in which there is a long-standing three-way non-rhotic merger, to [e\{reversed, open\}:]. However, we suggest a system-internal cause, that coarticulation with the postvocalic /r/ may play a role in the contemporary Scottish vowel merger. Indeed, strongly rhotic middle-class Scottish speakers have recently been found to produce postvocalic approximant /r/ using a markedly different tongue configuration from working-class Scottish speakers, who also tend to derhoticise /r/. We present the results of an ultrasound tongue imaging investigation into the differing coarticulatory effects of bunched and tongue-front raised /r/ variants on preceding vowels. We compare tongue shapes from two static points during rhotic syllable rimes. Phonetically, it appears that the bunched /r/ used by middle-class speakers exerts a stronger global coarticulatory force over preceding vowel tongue configurations than tongue-front raised /r/ does. This also results in a monophthongal rhotic target for what historically had been three distinct checked vowels. Phonologically, our view is that middle-class speakers of Scottish English have reduced the V+/r/ sequence to one segment; either a rhoticised vowel /e\{schwa, right hook\}/ or a syllabic rhotic /r/. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Twenty-six participants completed consonant and vowel identification tasks in quiet and noise. To investigate if predicted difficulties with vowel perception were also present in production, participants also recorded vowels embedded in words and read a short story. The results demonstrated that all learners were better able to identify consonants than vowels in quiet and noise, with more experienced learners outperforming early learners. Although learners were likely able to rely on mapping non-native to native categories when identifying consonants, there was some evidence that they had started to establish new vowel targets. This appeared to start early in learning but even highly experienced learners continued to find vowels with no direct Arabic counterpart difficult. Additionally, there was some evidence for a link between perception and production: vowel perception was better in those who had more accurate production. Overall, the results shed light on problematic phonemic contrasts for Arabic learners, and suggest that though learners may be able to establish new phonetic categories early in learning, other contrasts continue to remain difficult even for highly experienced learners.},

This paper presents an auditory and acoustic analysis of variation in non-prevocalic /r/ among middle-aged adults from Edinburgh, Scotland. The speakers represent three groups: the Established Middle Class (EMC) and the Working Class (WC), both of which are characterized as socioeconomically non-mobile, and a third group we call the New Middle Class (NMC), comprising individuals born to working-class families and living middle-class lives at the time of data collection. The results demonstrate that realizations of /r/ have a significant correlation with socioeconomic status, and that the effect of class further interacts with gender. NMC speakers demonstrate the highest level of rhoticity of all three groups. In contrast, WC men show extensive derhoticization and deletion, while WC women show patterns of rhoticity that are more comparable to the NMC women. The EMC speakers show more non-rhoticity than either the NMC speakers or the WC women. A consideration of the indexical value of weak rhoticity highlights the need for more robust phonetic measures distinguishing non-rhoticity from derhoticization, and to that end we consider the cue of post-vocalic frication. Overall, the results point to the need to conceptualize socioeconomic status as potentially fluid and changeable across the lifespan, thereby improving models of the relationship between social class and linguistic variation.},

Some have argued that the difficulty in distinguishing these illicit-licit pairs is due to a "perceptual illusion" caused by the phonological system, which prevents listeners from accurately perceiving a phonotactically unattested consonant cluster. In this study, we explore this and other sources of perceptual illusion by presenting English listeners with non-native word-initial clusters paired with various modifications, including epenthesis, deletion, C1change, and prothesis, in both AX and ABX discrimination tasks (e.g. [zmatu]-[zeschwamatu], [matu], [smatu], or [eschwazmatu]). For English listeners, fricative-initial sequences are most often confused with prothesis, stop-nasal sequences with deletion or change of the first consonant, and stop-stop sequences with vowel insertion. The pattern of results across tasks indicates that in addition to interference from the phonological system, sources of perceptual illusion include language-specific phonetic knowledge, the acoustic similarity of the stimulus items, the task itself, and the number of modifications to illicit sequences used in the experiment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the present paper, we examine data from two closely matched groups of middle-aged male RP speakers, recorded in 1929 and 2010, demonstrating that corpus-based comparisons can be extended further back in time than previously done. Investigating pitch and durational characteristics of their speech, we also show historical investigations can go beyond the segment.

	abstract = {The evolution of speech can be studied independently of the evolution of language, with the advantage that most aspects of speech acoustics, physiology and neural control are shared with animals, and thus open to empirical investigation. At least two changes were necessary prerequisites for modern human speech abilities: (1) modification of vocal tract morphology, and (2) development of vocal imitative ability. Despite an extensive literature, attempts to pinpoint the timing of these changes using fossil data have proven inconclusive. However, recent comparative data from nonhuman primates have shed light on the ancestral use of formants (a crucial cue in human speech) to identify individuals and gauge body size. Second, comparative analysis of the diverse vertebrates that have evolved vocal imitation (humans, cetaceans, seals and birds) provides several distinct, testable hypotheses about the adaptive function of vocal mimicry. These developments suggest that, for understanding the evolution of speech, comparative analysis of living species provides a viable alternative to fossil data. However, the neural basis for vocal mimicry and for mimesis in general remains unknown. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The most widely validated measure of social class, the Nuffield class schema, developed in the 1970s, was codified in the UK’s National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) and places people in one of seven main classes according to their occupation and employment status. This principally distinguishes between people working in routine or semi-routine occupations employed on a ‘labour contract’ on the one hand, and those working in professional or managerial occupations employed on a ‘service contract’ on the other. However, this occupationally based class schema does not effectively capture the role of social and cultural processes in generating class divisions. We analyse the largest survey of social class ever conducted in the UK, the BBC’s 2011 Great British Class Survey, with 161,400 web respondents, as well as a nationally representative sample survey, which includes unusually detailed questions asked on social, cultural and economic capital. Using latent class analysis on these variables, we derive seven classes. We demonstrate the existence of an ‘elite’, whose wealth separates them from an established middle class, as well as a class of technical experts and a class of ‘new affluent’ workers. We also show that at the lower levels of the class structure, alongside an ageing traditional working class, there is a ‘precariat’ characterised by very low levels of capital, and a group of emergent service workers. We think that this new seven class model recognises both social polarisation in British society and class fragmentation in its middle layers, and will attract enormous interest from a wide social scientific community in offering an up-to-date multi-dimensional model of social class.},

F1 \& F2 measurements of the short vowels suggest a classic chain shift, largely following Labov's Principles II \& III (although Labov's assumption that London short front vowels are rising is shown to be wrong). However, corresponding data from Reading, west of London, evidence no signs of a chain shift. The two datasets show identical targets for the changes in each town. Thus, there has been convergence between the two short vowel systems - from different starting points. We argue that a dialect contact model is more explanatory than internal factors in this case of regional dialect leveling in the south-east of England. 2 Tables, 16 Figures, 1 Appendix, 69 References.

The present study established a procedure for ascertaining a proclivity to RLS for individual listeners. In addition to RLS, variables reflecting degree of multicultural involvement (e.g., proportion of friends who are nonnative speakers, amount of language study) predicted speech evaluations. Although the RLS measurement procedure outlined here requires more demanding administration than mere paper-and-pencil self-reports, it has the advantage of reflecting authentic RLS processes. Measuring individuals' RLS levels can help screen teachers, job interviewers, immigration officials, and others who are called on to make judgments about the oral proficiency of speakers of nonprestige language varieties.},

The sound change that was analyzed in this paper, which is sometimes known as happY-tensing, concerns the tensing of the final vowel in words like 'happy' in British English Received Pronunciation over the course of the last 50 years. In the first part of the study, schwa vowels in Christmas broadcasts separated by 40-50 years were analyzed in order to exclude as far as possible any long-term acoustic effects due to vocal tract maturation. The results of this analysis show a large decrease in both the fundamental and F1, F2, and F4 from earlier to later broadcasts. It is then shown that the Queen's 1950s happY vowel is less tense than in a 1980s corpus of four female speakers of Standard Southern British. A subsequent comparison between the 1950s and 1990s Christmas broadcast happY vowels shows a small change towards the tenser position. It is argued that the vowels exemplified by KIT and happY have undergone phonetic raising in RP, with the latter also having fronted. The Queen has participated in the first of these changes and marginally in the second. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper compares this traditional target approach with two dynamic approaches for investigating regional patterns of variation: the multiple time point approach, which measures formants at successive time points, and the regression approach, which estimates formant dynamics over time by fitting polynomial regression equations to formant contours. The speech material consisted of monosyllabic words containing all full vowels of Dutch, except for /y/. These words were read out by 160 speakers of Standard Dutch, who were distributed over four regions in the Netherlands and four regions in Flanders, Belgium. The results show that dynamic approaches outperform the target approach in uncovering regional vowel differences, which suggests that sociophonetic vowel studies that apply the target approach run the risk of overlooking important sociolinguistic patterns.},

This essay considers real-life approximations of Chinese Rooms, focusing on Helen Keller’s experiences growing up deaf and blind, locked in a sort of Chinese Room yet learning how to communicate with the outside world. Using the SNePS computational knowledge-representation system, the essay analyzes Keller’s belief that learning that “everything has a name” was the key to her success, enabling her to “partition” her mental concepts into mental representations of: words, objects, and the naming relations between them. It next looks at Herbert Terrace’s theory of naming, which is akin to Keller’s, and which only humans are supposed to be capable of. The essay suggests that computers at least, and perhaps non-human primates, are also capable of this kind of naming.},

The motivation of this study is to contribute to a deeper understanding of accent variation across speakers from a cognitive perspective. The goal is to provide perceptual assessment of accent variation in native and English. The main focus is to investigate how listener's accent background affects accent perception and comprehensibility. The results from perceptual experiments show that the listeners' accent background impacts their ability to categorize accents. Speaker accent type affects perceptual accent classification. The interaction between listener accent background and speaker accent type is significant for both accent perception and speech comprehension. In addition, the results indicate that the comprehensibility of the speech contributes to accent perception. The outcomes point to the complex nature of accent perception, and provide a foundation for further investigation on the involvement of cognitive processing for accent perception. These findings contribute to a richer understanding of the cognitive aspects of accent variation, and its application for speech technology.},

This specific arrangement of segments within the syllable has been attributed in the previous literature to the principle of sonority sequencing, which relegates segments low in sonority towards syllable margins (see Hooper 1976; Kiparsky 1979, 1981; Steriade 1982; Selkirk 1984; Levin 1985; Clements 1990).},

	abstract = {Most linguistic theories assume lexicon entries which incorporate the idea of the Saussurean sign, a bidirectional mapping between a phonological form and some representation of a concept. This Sign, like grammars generally, is unbiased with respect to perception or production, and provides part of the cognitive map which speakers use both in speaking and in interpreting the utterances of others. This bidirectionality of the Sign, or code, is a design feature of human language although workable communication does not necessarily incorporate such a feature. Part of the Language Acquisition Device is a mechanism which mentally constructs such a biderectional mapping, on the basis of observed samples of communicative behaviour (transmission and reception). This basic aspect of the LAD presumably evolved because of its superiority over other conceivable mechanisms for acquiring a basis for communicative behaviour from a sampling of observed transmission and reception data. Three conceivable strategies for acquiring the basis of communicative behaviour, here labelled the Imitator, Calculator, and Saussurean strategies, are defined as functions from samplings of observed behaviour to acquired behaviour patterns. Essentially, the Imitator imitates the transmission and reception patterns in the observed sample; the Calculator constructs optimal reception responses to the transmissions in the observed sample and optimal transmission responses to receptions in the observed sample; the Saussurean imitates the transmission behaviour in the sample, but shapes his reception behaviour to mirror the acquired transmission behaviour, thus internalizing the equivalent of a set of bidirectional Saussurean signs. Extensive simulations of populations endowed with these innate strategies show the Saussurean strategy to be a winner in evolutionary terms; it produces individuals who communicate more successfully than individuals endowed with the other two strategies. ?? 1989.},

The eleven monophthongs were spoken in /hVd/ contexts by five men in each age group. The eleven words, together with nineteen filler words chosen to distract attention from the purpose of the experiment, were randomized four times and read by each speaker in citation form, for a total of 880 items. F1 and F2 frequencies were measured in Hz and ERB-rate. As expected, in younger compared with older speakers, F1 is higher in /E/ and especially /oe/, and F2 is higher in /u…/ and /U/. Other vowels varied in overall dispersion of F1 or F2, but no other differences between age groups were observed. There is evidence that the oldest age group to show change in a vowel's quality has particularly large differences between individuals, so that, collectively, members of that group span much of the quality range from 'conservative' (older groups) to 'progressive' (younger groups). Such so-called 'break groups' have implications for theoretical explanations of sound change.},

This paper describes a number of simulations performed with a genetic algorithm to investigate the conditions necessary for such communication systems to evolve. The first simulation shows that Saussurean communication evolves in the simple case where direct selective pressure is placed on individuals to be both good transmitters and good receivers. The second simulation demonstrates that, in the more realistic case where selective pressure is only placed on doing well as a receiver, Saussurean communication fails to evolve. Two methods, inspired by research on the Prisoner's Dilemma, are used to attempt to solve this problem. The third simulation shows that, even in the absence of selective pressure on transmission, Saussurean communication can evolve if individuals interact multiple times with the same communication partner and are given the ability to respond differentially based on past interaction. In the fourth simulation, spatially organized populations are used, and it is shown that this allows Saussurean communication to evolve through kin selection.},

	abstract = {This article reviews Lexical Phonology, a theory of rules and derivations. Rules are of three types: cyclic rules, postcyclic rules, and postlexical rules. Various diag-nostic properties of rules are discussed, including the phonological cycle, word vs. phrase domain application, the Strict Cyclicity Constraint, derived environments, the Structure Preservation Constraint, lexical conditioning, and the interaction of phonology and morphology. The data are drawn from English, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Slovak. Lexical Phonology grew out of The Sound Pattern of English (SPE hereafter; Chomsky and Halle 1968) as a refinement of the structure of the phono-logical and the morphological components of the grammar. The roots of Lexical Phonology go back to Kiparsky (1973), Mascaró (1976), Halle (1978), and Rubach (1981). The opening paper for the theory was Kiparsky's (1982) 'From Cyclic to Lexical Phonology'. The lexical framework inspired the research of the 1980s and 1990s, as I explain in Section 6. Today, Lexical Phonology remains the source of insight especially in two lines of pho-nological investigation: Distributed Morphology (DM) and Derivational Optimality Theory (DOT). It is for this reason that the theory merits attention in spite of the fact that it is no longer practised in the form as described in this article. Lexical Phonology is a theory of rules and derivations. It is a theory of rules, because it claims that rules are universally of three types: cyclic rules, postcyclic rules, and postlexical rules. It is a theory of derivations, because it claims that the way in which the derivation is organized is crucial to phonological analysis. In particular, some derivations proceed in steps, called cycles, while others do not. Non-cyclic derivations are of two types: word level derivations and postsyntactic derivations. Lexical Phonology is an extreme embodiment of Chomsky's (1970) lexicalist hypothesis. It is extreme because it claims that all word formation, including inflection, takes place in the lexicon. Furthermore, word formation rules (WFR hereafter) interact with a subset of phonological rules called cyclic rules. This interaction is possible, because cyclic},

The analysis offered below is therefore an alternative to the traditional rule-based analyses of English syllabification, e.g. Kahn (1976), Borowsky (1986), Giegerich (1992, 1999) and to the Optimality-Theoretic treatment proposed by Hammond (1999), whose analysis requires several language-specific constraints which apparently have no cross-linguistic motivation.},

An analysis of the monophthongal formant space showed that the first formant frequency was generally higher for open vowels, and lower for mid-high vowels in the 1960's and 1980's data than in the 1950's data, which we interpret as an expansion of phonetic height from earlier to later years. The second formant frequency showed a more modest compression in later, compared with earlier years: in general, front vowels had a decreased F2 in later years, while F2 of the back vowels was unchanged except for [u] which had a higher F2 in the 1960's and 1980's data. We also show that the majority of these Fl and F2 changes were in the direction of the vowel positions of 1980's Standard Southern British speakers reported in Deterding (1997). Our general conclusion is that there is evidence of accent change within the same individual over time and that the Queen's vowels in the Christmas broadcasts have shifted in the direction of a more mainstream form of Received Pronunciation.},

Young children's language and nonhuman primates' signing both appear formulaic with limited syntactic combinations, thereby suggesting a degree of continuity in their cognitive abilities. To evaluate the validity of this approach, as well as to develop a quantitative benchmark to assess children's language development, I propose a formal analysis that characterizes the statistical profile of grammatical rules. I show that very young children's language is consistent with a productive grammar rather than memorization of specific word combinations from caregivers' speech. Furthermore, I provide a statistically rigorous demonstration that the sign use of Nim Chimpsky, the chimpanzee who was taught American Sign Language, does not show the expected productivity of a rule-based grammar. Implications for theories of language acquisition and evolution are discussed.},

These data, along with paleoanthropological evidence, suggest that prelinguistic vocal substrates for protolanguage that had prosodic features similar to contemporary motherese evolved as the trend for enlarging brains in late australopithecines/early Homo progressively increased the difficulty of parturition, thus causing a selective shift toward females that gave birth to relatively undeveloped neonates. It is hypothesized that hominin mothers adopted new foraging strategies that entailed maternal silencing, reassuring, and controlling of the behaviors of physically removed infants (i.e., that shared human babies’ inability to cling to their mothers’ bodies). As mothers increasingly used prosodic and gestural markings to encourage juveniles to behave and to follow, the meanings of certain utterances (words) became conventionalized. This hypothesis is based on the premises that hominin mothers that attended vigilantly to infants were strongly selected for, and that such mothers had genetically based potentials for consciously modifying vocalizations and gestures to control infants, both of which receive support from the literature.},

The proposal consists of assigning to certain constraints bands of values along a reified continuum of constraint strictness. When a particular form can be generated only by assigning a constraint a strictness value within a designated “fringe” of the strictness band, the grammar generates the form marked with an intermediate degree of well-formedness. The proposal is tested against data involving light and dark /l/ in American English, using a set of gradient intuitions obtained from ten native speaker consultants. A rationale from language learning is then posited for why well-formedness intuitions are so frequently gradient.},

	abstract = {The dominant theory of the evolution of complex language from protolanguage can be termed the synthetic approach. Under this view, single words arose first in evolution, and were combined as syntax evolved. More recently, an alternative scenario for protolanguage has been proposed, which we can term the holistic approach. Scholars subscribing to this view propose that words emerge from longer, entirely arbitrary strings of sounds - non-compositional utterances - via a process of fractionation. Such holistic utterances initially have no internal structure, but represent whole messages. The idea is that over time, chance phonetic similarities are observed between sections of utterances, and that if similar meanings can be ascribed to these strings, then "words" will emerge. This paper dissects the main ideas found in the holistic approach, and argues on a number of grounds that it is conceptually and empirically flawed. A proposal that protolanguage developed out of an earlier holistic primate communication system is hard to sustain, in view of differences between primate vocalization and language. Evidence against the holistic approach is offered on the basis of known facts about the historical development of natural languages, and a conclusion is drawn in favour of synthetic models of protolanguage. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the phonetic pre-conditions for /s/-retraction based on the results of two experiments conducted with Australian English. Study 1 shows that the first spectral moment (M1) for /s/ is lower in /spr, str, skr/ and slightly lower in /sp, st, sk/ than in pre-vocalic position. Temporal variation in first spectral moment trajectories suggests that the articulatory movements associated with the rhotic are timed relatively earlier in /str/ vs. /spr, skr/ clusters. Study 2 tested native listener categorization of sibilants produced by multiple talkers. Results show that sibilants originally produced in stream and steam elicit /ʃ/ responses when spliced into pre-vocalic contexts. There was an interaction with talker gender, with male voices eliciting more /ʃ/ responses. Thus, the conditions for sound change to occur by which /s/ becomes /ʃ/ originate in a synchronic bias for /s/ produced in /sC(r)/ clusters to show increased auditory similarity to /ʃ/. Australian English shows the pre-conditions for /s/-retraction but is not currently undergoing this sound change.},

Language's evolutionary analysis is complicated because it has no equivalent in any nonhuman species. There is also no consensus regarding the essential nature of the language “phenotype.” According to the “Strong Minimalist Thesis,” the key distinguishing feature of language (and what evolutionary theory must explain) is hierarchical syntactic structure. The faculty of language is likely to have emerged quite recently in evolutionary terms, some 70,000–100,000 years ago, and does not seem to have undergone modification since then, though individual languages do of course change over time, operating within this basic framework. The recent emergence of language and its stability are both consistent with the Strong Minimalist Thesis, which has at its core a single repeatable operation that takes exactly two syntactic elements a and b and assembles them to form the set \{a, b\}.},

This second form of communication resembles the communication system of other primates much more closely than it resembles language, and it should be recognized as the primate communication system of the human species. Since our surviving primate communication system remains sharply distinct from language, it is implausible that it could have served as the base from which language evolved. The emergence of language from any earlier primate communication system is equally implausible. Given that language is inseparably bound up with human cognition, the most promising place to look for the antecedents of alnguage is in primate cognitive abilities. We are more likely to find hints about language origins by studying how primates use their minds than by studying how they communicate.},

@misc{Labov2008b,
	title = {Returning to the obvious: the ubiquity of categorical rules},
	abstract = {Recent work in the framework of exemplar theory has demonstrated that
speakers can retrieve a great deal of social information from their
stored memories of lexical forms. It is argued that categories are
indexed by probabilistic reference to regions of exemplar space,
populated with remembered words. In this model, the influence of
exemplars on production and perception is necessarily dependent on
their token frequency, so that word frequency strongly determines
phonetic output, and change is linked to lexical diffusion.

Much of this evidence on frequency effects has been drawn from lenition
processes like auxiliary contraction, where the amount of reduction
is proportional to lexical frequency. When we examine changes in
progress that are not linked to lenition, the situation looks quite
different. The widespread fronting of /uw/ and /ow/ across North
America shows a categorical constraint on fronting before liquids
independent of frequency or lexical membership. If we trace vowel
systems from the most conservative to the most advanced, we find
a sudden shift to systems where all vowels before /l/ and /r/ remain
back, and all others are fronted, with a gap of several hundred Hz
separating the two distributions. A similar categorical situation
is found in the development of the nasal system in tensing of short-a,
where all vowels with nasal codas are raised to high front position
and all others remain low front.

Proponents of exemplar theory argue that social information is inextricably
mixed with phonological and grammatical information in the remembered
words. Nevertheless, multivariate analyses regularly report independence
of internal and social factors. Such independence seems to hold for
some of the most prominent sociolinguistic variables like the T-V
pronouns of power and solidarity. For these variables, each token
has a clear social impact, unlike the stochastic effects of (ING)
and (r). It appears that the information on which form has been used
is stored independently of the part of speech used. Support for this
hypothesis is found in the recent work of Wallace on thou and you
in the 16th to 18th centuries. Across time, the frequency of thou
was strongly correlated with social factors, but no evidence of the
influence of part of speech or other grammatical categories was found.
It would follow that important social information is stored in a
form independent of whether speakers used the words thou, thee or
thy.

Although we do not want to lose the profit that has been gained from
the study of probabilistic distributions, a dispassionate overview
of change and variation shows that it rests upon a solid foundation
of categorical behavior.},

The data show that combining a variety of acoustic properties from the bursts and transitions for stop consonants leads to robust classification of place of articulation, particularly if the gender of the speaker and if the feature [back] in the adjacent vowel is known.},

The first is that sequences of variants produced by individuals display systematic patterns that can be understood in terms of sociostylistic conditioning and psychophysiological conditioning. The second is that psychophysiological conditioning and internal linguistic conditioning are distinct in their mental implementations; this claim has implications for understanding the locality of the factors conditioning alternations, the universality and language-specificity of variation, and the general question of whether grammar and language use are distinct. Questions about the dynamics of variation in individuals are set against community-centered perspectives to argue that findings in the two domains, though differing in explanatory focus, can ultimately be mutually informative.},

The results show a high correlation between the magnitude estimation data and the speeded grammaticality judgments data, both within a session and across the two sessions. The third experiment was a questionnaire study in which participants judged the same sentences as either gram- matical or ungrammatical without time pressure. This experiment yielded results quite similar to those of the other two experiments. Thus gradient and binary judg- ments both provide valuable and reliable sources for linguistic theory when assessed in an experimentally controlled way. We present a model based on Signal Detection Theory which specifies how gradient grammaticality scores are mapped to binary grammaticality judgments.

Previous studies of this phenomenon have used the variable rule program, a generalized linear model; however, recent developments in statistics have introduced new tools, including mixed-effects models, random forests, and conditional inference trees that may open additional possibilities for data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. In a step-by-step demonstration, we show how this well-known variable benefits from these complementary techniques. Mixed-effects models provide a principled way of assessing the importance of random-effect factors such as the individuals in the sample. Random forests provide information about the importance of predictors, whether factorial or continuous, and do so also for unbalanced designs with high multicollinearity, cases for which the family of linear models is less appropriate. Conditional inference trees straightforwardly visualize how multiple predictors operate in tandem. Taken together, the results confirm that polarity, distance from verb to plural element, and the nature of the DP are significant predictors. Ongoing linguistic change and social reallocation via morphologization are operational. Furthermore, the results make predictions that can be tested in future research. We conclude that variationist research can be substantially enriched by an expanded tool kit. The},

The suggestion is made that, in terms of providing a representation of variation at the first order of indexicality, the enregisterment of chavspeak is highly fragmented – a form from here and a form from there – but in terms of ideological force – intensifying sociolinguistic class stereotypes in accordance with the more general stereotype of the chav– there is a coherence. The intended humour of the stylisations is discussed as a feature that reinforces this ideological force, and the inclusion of stereotyped features of black Englishes is discussed as a possible emergent tendency in language ideologies in the British Isles.},

	abstract = {For a century, phoneticians have noted a vowel merger in middle-class Scottish English, in the neutralisation of prerhotic checked vowels /I\{small\}/, /v\{inverted\}/, /e\{open\}/ to a central vowel, e.g. fir, fur, fern [fe\{schwa\}r\{turned\}], [fe\{schwa\}r\{turned\}] [fe\{schwa\}r\{turned\}n], or [fe\{schwa, right hook\}], [fe\{schwa, right hook\}], [fe\{schwa, right hook\}n]. Working-class speakers often neutralise two of these checked vowels to a low back [v\{inverted\}] vowel, fir, fur, both pronounced as [fv\{inverted\}r\{turned\}] or as [fv\{inverted\}\{glottal stop, reversed\}]. The middle-class merger is often assumed to be an adaptation towards the UK's socially prestigious R.P. phonological system in which there is a long-standing three-way non-rhotic merger, to [e\{reversed, open\}:]. However, we suggest a system-internal cause, that coarticulation with the postvocalic /r/ may play a role in the contemporary Scottish vowel merger. Indeed, strongly rhotic middle-class Scottish speakers have recently been found to produce postvocalic approximant /r/ using a markedly different tongue configuration from working-class Scottish speakers, who also tend to derhoticise /r/. We present the results of an ultrasound tongue imaging investigation into the differing coarticulatory effects of bunched and tongue-front raised /r/ variants on preceding vowels. We compare tongue shapes from two static points during rhotic syllable rimes. Phonetically, it appears that the bunched /r/ used by middle-class speakers exerts a stronger global coarticulatory force over preceding vowel tongue configurations than tongue-front raised /r/ does. This also results in a monophthongal rhotic target for what historically had been three distinct checked vowels. Phonologically, our view is that middle-class speakers of Scottish English have reduced the V+/r/ sequence to one segment; either a rhoticised vowel /e\{schwa, right hook\}/ or a syllabic rhotic /r/. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first includes the sociolinguistic interview, and other activities focused directly on forms, and critiques of Labov's methods. The second includes quantitative methods and raises some broader issues around triangulation. The third includes the complementary use of attitudes and perception data with production data. It concludes by suggesting that Labov's body of work has also contributed to the creation of a distinct, sociolinguistic community of practice.

	title = {The dynamical approach to speech perception: {From} fine phonetic detail to abstract phonological categories},
	abstract = {Much research has been devoted to exploring the representations and pro-cesses employed by listeners in the perception of speech. There is in that domain a longstanding debate between two opposite approaches. Abstrac-tionist models, on the one hand, are based on the assumption that an abstract and speaker-independent phonological representation is associated with each word in the listener's mental lexicon. In exemplar models of speech percep-tion, on the other hand, words and frequently-used grammatical constructions are represented in memory as large sets of exemplars containing fine phonetic information. In the present paper, the opposition between abstractionist and exemplar models will be discussed in light of recent experimental findings that call this opposition into question. In keeping with recent proposals made by other researchers, we will argue that both fine phonetic detail and abstract phonological categories are likely to play an important role in speech per-ception. A novel, hybrid approach, that aims to get beyond the abstraction vs. exemplar dichotomy and draws on the theory of nonlinear dynamical sys-tems, as applied to the perception of speech by Tuller et al. (1994), will be outlined. 1. Two approaches to the perception of speech In spite of the huge variability shown by the speech signal both within and across speakers, listeners are in most situations able to identify spoken words and get access to their meaning in an effortless manner. A major challenge in studies of speech perception is to understand how such variations in the pronunciation of words are dealt with by listeners in the sound-to-meaning mapping. There is still much disagreement about the nature of the processes and representations that this mapping may involve.},

With particular reference to Silverstein's discussion of second-order indexicality, it argues that language varieties in Britain and the United States are differently ideologized in such a way as to foreground social class groups in Britain and ethnic groups in the United States. This difference gives rise to characteristically different kinds of national language controversy. American and British images of a spoken standard language are not only quite different but also occupy a pivotal position in their respective ideological systems. In America, a leveled variety is imagined as standard and mainstream, while in Britain an elite classmarked variety is commonly imagined as standard. Each type of standard, while imagined as a neutral reference point, sets up a pattern of structural oppositions that foregrounds and stigmatizes the codes indexing "nonmainstream" groups in the United States and "lower-class" groups in Britain.},

The same measure is used to assess regularity of vocal fold vibration in an interval just prior to the formation of the total closure for instances of syllable-final /t/, and confirms significantly lower autocorrelation in a group auditorily judged 'pre-glottalized'.

Fortunately, as shown by textual analysis of a typical theoretical syntax paper (Li, 1998), syntacticians already recognize the value of proper experimental designs and quantitative analyses, albeit in nascent forms. Small-scale judgment experiments build on this foundation by applying the minimum amount of extra effort needed to draw valid statistical inferences from the type of data most familiar to syntacticians, namely binary judgments involving very few speakers and sentences. Statistical methods appropriate for such data, some hitherto underused, are described, and software tools for automating small-scale judgment experimentation are introduced. The simplicity and power of the methods are then illustrated in a small-scale test of the claims in Li (1998) on naive Chinese speakers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

While there is rather general agreement about this chief objective of science, there exists considerable difference of opinion as to the function and the essential characteristics of scien- tific explanation. In the present essay, an attempt will be made to shed some light on these issues by means of an elementary survey of the basic pattern of scientific explanation and a subsequent more rigorous analysis of the concept of law and of the logical structure of explanatory arguments. The elementary survey is presented in Part I of this article; Part I1 contains an analysis of the concept of emergence; in Part 111, an attempt is made to exhibit and to clarify in a more rigorous manner some of the peculiar and per- plexing logical problems to which the familiar elementary analysis of explanation gives rise. Part IV, finally, is devoted to an examination of the idea of explana- tory power of a theory; an explicit definition, and, based on it, a formal theory of this concept are developed for the case of a scientific language of simple logical structure.},

The same speakers participated in a forced-choice perception experiment in which they categorized a synthetic /ɪ-ʊ/ continuum embedded in fronting /s\_t/ and non-fronting /w\_l/ contexts. /ʊ/ was shown to be fronted for the younger age group in both production and perception. Although there was no conclusive evidence that younger listeners compensated less for coarticulation than did older listeners, the size of the coarticulatory influence of consonantal context on /ʊ/ in perception was found to be smaller than in production for the younger than for the older group. The findings are consistent with a model of sound change in which the perceptual compensation for coarticulation wanes ahead of changes that take place to coarticulatory relationships in speech production. As a result, the perception and production of coarticulation may be unusually misaligned with respect to each other for some speaker-listeners participating in a sound change in progress. Keywords},

Previous work has shown that listeners can differ- entiate words in phrasal creak from those with /t/ glottalization, which suggests that there are acoustic differences between the creaky voice derived from phrasal creak and /t/ glottalization. In this study, we analyzed vowels preceding syllable-final /t/ in the Buckeye Corpus, which includes audio recordings of spon- taneous speech from 40 speakers of American English. Tokens were coded for presence of phrasal creak (prolonged irregular voicing extending beyond the target syllable) and /t/ glottaliza- tion (whether the /t/ was produced only with glottal constric- tion). Eleven spectral measures of voice quality, including both harmonic and noise measures, were extracted automatically and discriminant analyses were performed. The results indicate that the discriminant functions can classify these sources of creaky voice above chance, and that Cepstral Peak Prominence, a mea- sure of harmonics-to-noise ratio, is important for distinguishing phrasal creak from glottalization.},

The effects of phonological context and speaking style are also examined. Patterns in the data are suggestive of dialect leveling, whereby localized speech variants become recessive and pronunciations typical of a wider geographical area are adopted. Within this broad pattern, however, there is evidence of parallelism be- tween the vowels in terms of the relative proportions of their variants across speaker groups. It is suggested that pressure to maintain the symmetrical structure of the underlying phonological system is guiding this process. Labov’s (1991, 1994) prin- ciples of chain shift are discussed in this connection. However, it is argued that the patterns in the data are more plausibly explained by considering the social signifi- cance of each variant instead of making reference to variants as socially neutral expressions of abstract phonological categories.},

Results illustrate that (1) there were consistent overall style effects, several of which (consonant duration, spectral peak frequency, and spectral moments) were consistent with previous findings and a few (notably consonant-to-vowel intensity ratio) of which were not; (2) specific acoustic modifications in clear productions of fricatives were influenced by the nature of the recognition errors that prompted the productions and were consistent with efforts to emphasize potentially misperceived contrasts both within the English fricative inventory and based on feedback from the simulated listener; and (3) talkers differed widely in the types and magnitude of all modifications.},

The variations/changes looked for were: CLOTH transfer, CURE lowering, GOAT allophony, R-sandhi, and T-voicing. The procedure of the study was to identify the presence or absence of these features in the speech of certain individuals in recordings made over a period of at least 35 years. The individuals studied were: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Baroness Thatcher, Sir David Attenborough and David Dimbleby. The results of these comparisons suggest that individual speakers are not greatly affected by changes in pronunciation taking place around them and generally stay with the preferred pronunciation of their youth.

Working-class speakers often neutralise two of these checked vowels to a low back [v\{inverted\}] vowel, fir, fur, both pronounced as [fv\{inverted\}r\{turned\}] or as [fv\{inverted\}\{glottal stop, reversed\}]. The middle-class merger is often assumed to be an adaptation towards the UK's socially prestigious R.P. phonological system in which there is a long-standing three-way non-rhotic merger, to [e\{reversed, open\}:]. However, we suggest a system-internal cause, that coarticulation with the postvocalic /r/ may play a role in the contemporary Scottish vowel merger. Indeed, strongly rhotic middle-class Scottish speakers have recently been found to produce postvocalic approximant /r/ using a markedly different tongue configuration from working-class Scottish speakers, who also tend to derhoticise /r/. We present the results of an ultrasound tongue imaging investigation into the differing coarticulatory effects of bunched and tongue-front raised /r/ variants on preceding vowels. We compare tongue shapes from two static points during rhotic syllable rimes. Phonetically, it appears that the bunched /r/ used by middle-class speakers exerts a stronger global coarticulatory force over preceding vowel tongue configurations than tongue-front raised /r/ does. This also results in a monophthongal rhotic target for what historically had been three distinct checked vowels. Phonologically, our view is that middle-class speakers of Scottish English have reduced the V+/r/ sequence to one segment; either a rhoticised vowel /e\{schwa, right hook\}/ or a syllabic rhotic /r/. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

I have defined standardisation (Trudgill, 1992) as consisting of the processes of language determination, codification and stabilisation. Language determination “refers to decisions which have to be taken concerning the selection of particular languages or varieties of language for particular purposes in the society or nation in question” (p.71). Codification is the process whereby a language variety “acquires a publicly recognised and fixed form”. The results of codification “are usually enshrined in dictionaries and grammar books” (p.17). Stabilisation is a process whereby a formerly diffuse variety (in the sense of Le Page and Tabouret-Keller,1985) “undergoes focussing and takes on a more fixed and stable form” (p.70).},

	abstract = {The accent described here is the present-day version of the accent that has been used as the standard in phoneticians' description of the pronunciation of British English for centuries. The definition of this accent is a matter of heated debate and frequent controversy: the arguments will not be rehearsed here, but the interested reader is recommended to look at Jones (1917 and subsequent) and Wells (2000). The most important aspects of this accent should, however, be made clear: a. The number of native speakers of this accent who originate in Ireland, Scotland and Wales is very small and probably diminishing, and it is therefore a misnomer to call it an accent of BRITISH English. It is an accent spoken by some English people. b. The great majority of native speakers of this accent are of middle-class or upper-class origin, educated at private schools and (if of appropriate age) university. This does not mean that the accent cannot be acquired by others: the present author (who attended a state school in the Midlands) originally spoke with an accent with noticeable regional features, but has over many years of teaching the phonetics of English acquired an accent not far from the standard one described here. c. The majority of speakers of this accent live in, or originate from, the south-east of England. d. The accent is most familiar as that used by most 'official' BBC speakers of English origin (newsreaders and announcers on Radio 4 and Radio 3, and most television channels). It is also frequently heard on the BBC World Service, though that service appears to have adopted the policy of sometimes using newsreaders and announcers with noticeable foreign accents. It is clear that this accent will eventually lose its pre-eminent status in broadcasting as a result of the wish to broaden the social base of broadcast speech, but it will take a long time for this to happen. The accent has been known for nearly a century as RECEIVED PRONUNCIATION, or by its abbreviation, RP. Early in the 20th century, Daniel Jones, the great exponent of the description of English pronunciation, named it PUBLIC SCHOOL PRONUNCIATION (Jones 1917), but later changed the name to Received Pronunciation. Other names have been proposed, such as GENERAL BRITISH (GB) and EDUCATED SOUTHERN BRITISH ENGLISH. The present author's own preference is for the name BBC PRONUNCIATION or BBC ACCENT (Jones, ed. by Roach et al. 2003), but given the continuing popularity of the name Received Pronunciation, this has been used for the description which follows.},

It is assumed that self-awareness is a second-order state either in the domain of experience or in the domain of thought. In the former case self-awareness turns out empty if experience is transparent. In the latter, it can best be conceived of as a form of mental quotation. Various proposed analyses of direct and indirect quotation are discussed and tested regarding their applicability to thought.

	title = {Continuous {Acceptability}, {Categorical} {Grammaticality}, and {Experimental} {Syntax}},
	volume = {1},
	url = {http://www.biolinguistics.eu},
	abstract = {1. Introduction It almost goes without saying that acceptability judgments form a continuous spectrum. While many sentences are either clearly acceptable or clearly unaccept-able, a significant number of sentences fall somewhere in between in a gray area of partial acceptability. This fact has been explicitly admitted by linguists since at least Chomsky 1965. The working assumption adopted by most linguists over the past 40 years has been that these intermediate levels of acceptability are caused by properties other than grammatical knowledge. Linguists have assumed that grammatical knowledge is categorical — sentences are either grammatical or ungrammatical — and that the continuous spectrum of acceptability is caused by extra-grammatical factors (plausibility, working memory limitations, etc.). Of course, ideas such as strength of violation have been introduced into theories of grammatical knowledge at various times, for instance Huang's (1982) proposal that ECP violations are stronger than Subjacency violations or Chomsky's (1986) proposal that each barrier crossed leads to lower acceptability. However, with the notable exception of Optimality Theory (see especially Keller 2000, 2003), these analyses have been the exception rather than the rule. The past ten years or so have seen a major shift in attitudes toward intermediate levels of acceptability. With the increasing use of formal experimental methods for measuring acceptability — a methodology that has come to be known as experimental syntax — it has become almost trivial to detect subtle differences along a continuous spectrum of acceptability. This new power afforded by experimental syntax raises the question of whether the continuity of acceptability reflects a continuity in grammatical knowledge that should be captured by the theory of grammar, or in other words, whether the working assumption of the past 40 years should be abandoned (see especially Keller 2000, Fanselow et al. 2004). While the answer to this question is ultimately an empirical one that is far from being settled, this report presents two pieces of experimental evidence for a categorical distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. The first is a direct prediction of theories that assume categorical grammaticality. The psychological claim underlying theories of categorical grammaticality is that ungrammatical sentences have no licit representation, or in other words, cannot be constructed from the available mental computations. Grammatical sentences, Biolinguistics  Reports  119 on the other hand, have licit representations that can be constructed from the available mental computations. This predicts that extra-grammatical factors that affect the acceptability and are predicated on the existence of a representation, such as syntactic priming (Luka \& Barsalou 2005), should not affect the accepta-bility of ungrammatical sentences. Section 2 presents results from Sprouse (2007) that confirm this prediction: Ungrammatical sentences, in particular island violations (Ross 1967), do not show a structural priming effect. The second piece of evidence comes from the experimental syntax technique magnitude estimation. Unlike traditional tasks such as the yes/no–task and the Likert scale task in which subjects must categorize their responses, magnitude estimation allows subjects to respond using the theoretically infinite continuum of values available on the positive number line (see Bard et al. 1996). By removing the categorization aspect of the task, one might expect that res-ponses would no longer show any categorical distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Contrary to this prediction, section 3 presents evidence from Sprouse (2007) that subjects impose a form of categorization on magnitude estimation responses, and that this categorization appears to correspond with the grammatical/ungrammatical distinction. 2.

The various methods were used to identify whether and on what basis or bases speakers of these two languages differ in f0 range. Findings yielded significant cross-language differences in both dimensions of f0 range, but effect sizes were found to be larger for span than for level, and for linguistic than for LTD measures. The linguistic measures also uncovered some differences between the two languages in how f0 range varies through an intonation contour. This helps shed light on the relation between intonational structure and f0 range.},

	abstract = {This paper presents results from two experiments designed to show how duration and intensity are processed during speech perception. Duration and intensity are two physical dimensions which are known to interact psychoacoustically in the perception of both length (a term that will be used for perceived duration) and loudness. The first experiment, a selective attention task, shows that length and loudness are processed as a unit [integrally, in the terms of Garner, The Processing of Information and Structure (Erlbaum, Potomac, MD, 1974)], but that the integrality is asymmetric: Extracting length information appears to be easier than extracting loudness information. The results of the first experiment make the prediction that listeners would not use loudness by itself in making prominence judgments, since the extraction of loudness in the presence of duration variation appears to require a (relatively) high processing load. The second experiment, a traditional trading relation experiment in which duration and intensity were varied orthogonally, appears to bear out this prediction. Listeners' responses were predicted from computed measures of length and loudness in a linear multiple regression analysis. Results show a negligible independent contribution of loudness to listeners' responses. Listeners' behavior is best predicted by computed measures of length.},

@article{Tamminga2014,
	title = {Persistence in the production of linguistic variation},
	abstract = {This dissertation, which is situated in broad debates over the delineation of abstract grammatical knowledge from the use of language in context, argues for distinct but inter- acting contributions from grammatical, psychological, and social factors in the production of intraspeaker linguistic variability. The phenomenon under investigation is the tendency of speakers to repeat recently-used linguistic options in conversational speech, which I re- fer to as persistence. I take up three major themes: the use of persistence as evidence on the mental-representational unity of variable linguistic processes; the interaction of differ- ent loci of variation with different cognitively-rooted facilitatory effects; and the contextual sensitivity of persistence to both social and grammatical expectations. The core results of this dissertation are based on data from 122 interviews drawn from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus (Labov and Rosenfelder, 2011). I argue for dis- tinct phonological and morphological processes in the production of the common mor- phophonological variables ING (working/workin), TD (old/ol), and DH (them/dem/em), with morphological variation showing generalized persistence while phonological varia- tion is persistent only under conditions of lexical repetition. Specifically, I propose that verbal and nominal ING constitute distinct variables, as do past tense and monomorphemic TD, and that the alternation between stop and continuant consonants in DH is morpho- logical in nature. The quantitative decay profiles of these variables, I suggest, tie their phonological versus morphological loci to their representation in episodic versus abstract memory systems. Although the driving force behind persistence, in this view, is the operation of various general cognitive processes, I further argue that these processes reflect speakers’ sociolin- guistic awareness in a way that supports a holistic expectation-based view of persistence asymmetries. The quantitative results and new questions in this dissertation set the stage for continued progress toward an integrated model of how social, grammatical, and psy- chological forces contribute to the production of linguistic variation.},

This study examined whether speakers of dialects of the same language with different phoneme inventories also show measurably different neural responses to contrasts not present in their dialect. Speakers with (n = 11) and without (n = 11) an American English I/E (pin/pen) vowel merger in speech production were asked to discriminate perceptually between minimal pairs of words that contrasted in the critical vowel merger and minimal pairs of control words while their event-related potential (ERPs) were recorded. Compared with unmerged dialect speakers, merged dialect speakers were less able to make behavioral discriminations and exhibited a reduced late positive ERP component (LPC) effect to incongruent merger vowel stimuli. These results indicate that between dialects of a single language, the behavioral response differences may reflect neural differences related to conscious phonological decision processes. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Splittable compounds (SCs) are verbal constructions in Chinese that consist of two parts which are separable by some interposing elements, though they behave like and are usually considered as single words when they are not separated. For many years, SCs in Chinese have presented a challenge to existing morphological and syntactic theories for their morpho-syntactic status. The present study takes a corpus-based approach to the SCs in their interaction with morphology, syntax, and pragmatics, aiming at producing a systematic and realistic account of SCs as attested in 2 million words of authentic spoken and written Chinese data. The results show that the typical grammatical pattern of SCs is constitutive of an aspect marker (-le, -zhe, -guo) or resultative verb complements as post-verbal adjacent elements (54\% of all SCs), and a quantifier, a classifier, a modifier or a combination of two or more of them which precede the nominal components of SCs. Drawing on morpho-syntactic and phonological criteria, the split uses, together with their combined uses, of SCs with one inserted aspectual morpheme are viewed as words, while the others are regarded as phrases. From a discourse-pragmatic perspective, the split use of SCs is more often found in the spoken genres of Chinese. Insertions of SCs tend to function as mitigation or modification to the verbal heads or final nominal/complement elements. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

A "short" vowel tended to attract consonants to its syllable, as did a stressed vowel. Finally, different syllabifications were produced for clusters like /dr/, which show the typical rise in sonority from the first consonant to the second, and /st/ clusters, which do not. Implications of the results for linguistic theories of syllabification and for studies of the syllable's role in speech perception and reading are discussed. © 1990.},

	title = {Ecology of {PF}: a study of {Korean} phonology and morphology in a derivational approach},
	abstract = {This dissertation studies the component of PF, i.e., morphology, phonology
and phonetics, in Korean in a consistently derivational approach.
Using phonological arguments and an acoustic phonetic study, chapter
2 identifies the surface syllable structure. It also recognizes the
two syllable structure constraints: the complex onset constraint
and the branching nucleus constraint. Using this syllable structure
and these constraints, chapter 3 provides a comprehensive analysis
of hiatus in verbal morphology and related issues within Calabrese's
(1995, 2002a) Dynamic Phonology framework. A limited number of actual
outcomes for similar hiatus configurations show that the constraint-induced
repairs are not finite but limited, and subject to the general principle
of economy. It is shown that economy chooses shorter derivations
over longer ones, when more than one derivation is possible and yield
the same final outcome. It also shows that the hiatus constraint
is a non-surface, cyclic constraint, operating once per morpho¬phonological
cycle. Furthermore, it argues that certain phonological operations
must be described with the traditional rule-like formalism. It is
also pointed out that the syllable structure constraints identified
in chapter 2 are surface constraints. Chapters 4 and 5 provide a
morphological study in Distributed Morphology (Bobaljik 2000, Halle
and Marantz 1993, Marantz 2006). With verbal and adjectival roots
exhibiting negative and honorific suppletion, these chapters identify
the morphological structure of the inflected predicates (and hence
phrase structure to a certain extent) in Korean. It identifies the
paradoxical situation arising from the interaction of negative suppletion
and honorific suppletion: the structurally outer honorific morphology
blocks the inner negative suppletion. Root allomorphy of honorific
suppletion is analyzed as vocabulary insertion, and the portmanteau
negative suppletion is characterized as fusion interleaved with vocabulary
insertion. The notion of phases (Chomsky 2000, et seq.) explains
the unavailability of honorific suppletion with causatives. The dissertation
resolves the issue of opacity, the major problem of a representational
and parallelist theory The derivational approach allows a coherent
and more adequate grammatical analysis of Korean morpho-phonology.
It highlights the ecological nature of language, in that language
is a living, dynamic and organic body, and more than simply a static
or representational object.},

We examine /u/-fronting and /j/-dropping in data from three generations of Derby English speakers. We analyze dynamic formant data and auditory judgments, using mixed effects regression methods, including generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs). /u/-fronting is reaching its end-point, showing complex conditioning by context and a frequency effect that weakens over time. /j/-dropping is declining, with low-frequency words showing more innovative variants with /j/ than high-frequency words. The two processes interact: words with variable /j/-dropping (new) exhibit more fronting than words that never have /j/ (noodle) even when the /j/ is deleted. These results support models of change that rely on phonetically detailed representations for both word- and sound-level cognitive units.},

We demonstrate that the social meanings of these variables are both historically substantiated and locally-elaborated. Our data is taken from the speech of individuals living on the Isles of Scilly, a group of islands off the south-west coast of England. Our initial analysis shows that TRAP and BATH variants found on the islands are linked to contact with Standard English English, on the one hand, and the nearest neighbouring variety of Cornish English, on the other. The general distribution of variants is shown to reflect educational differences amongst our speakers. However, two case studies show speakers using forms atypical of their education type in order to position themselves in interactionally-dynamic ways. This reveals how speakers exploit the multidimensional meanings of linguistic variants to reflect and construct local practices and alignments.},

First, phonetically gradient patterns of variation are alleged to be controlled by rules which operate outside the lexicon. Second, phonological rules applying within the lexicon may only refer to feature values that are already marked in underlying representations. This paper sets out to test these claims against empirical data of the sort that have been reported in the sociolinguistic literature. While the first claim appears to be in tune with some informal analyses already offered by sociolinguists, the second is contradicted by at least some of the evidence.},

However, in contrast to previous research, morphological class is not significant. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis that -t,-d deletion is a variable rule that applies both lexically and post- lexically. In sum, -t,-d deletion is a robust phenomenon in contemporary British English, but there are striking differences between British and North American varieties. Such differences suggest that -t,-d deletion is an ideal case study for fur- ther investigation of the phonology-phonetics interface, and adds to the available evidence from which an explanatory account of -t,-d deletion can be constructed.

The study used an expanded form of the Matched Guise Technique, using recordings collected through sociolinguistic interviews with 8 speakers from North Carolina and California. Excerpts were digitally manipulated to create 32 matched pairs differing only in tokens of (ING), which were used to collect responses in group interviews (N = 55) and a Web-based experiment (N = 124). The alveolar variant -in increased the perceived strength of Southern accents and dampened an accent heard as gay and urban. The influence of (ING) on these accents is linked to shared social meanings of the alveolar form -in and Southern accents on the one hand (lack of education, the country, and the term "redneck") and the velar variant -ing and the gay accent on the other (lowered masculinity, the city, and the term "metrosexual"). These two accents are contrasted with a third variety, heard as nonaccented and aregional. These effects demonstrate the status of the three linguistic objects, the two accents and (ING), as social objects as well.},

Here, we provide, using recent examples from the behavioural ecology literature, a simple introductory guide to AIC: what it is, how and when to apply it and what it achieves. We discuss multimodel inference using AIC—a procedure which should be used where no one model is strongly supported. Finally, we highlight a few of the pitfalls and problems that can be encountered by novice practitioners.},

Subjects were tested in their production and perception at regular intervals over a period of 2 years: before beginning university, 3 months later, and at the end of their first and second years at university. At each testing session, subjects were recorded reading a set of experimental words and a short passage. Subjects also completed two perceptual tasks; they chose best exemplar locations for vowels embedded in either northern or southern English accented carrier sentences and identified words in noise spoken with either a northern or southern English accent. The results demonstrated that subjects at a late stage in their language development, early adulthood, changed their spoken accent after attending university. There were no reliable changes in perception over time, but there was evidence for a between-subjects link between production and perception; subjects chose similar vowels to the ones they produced, and subjects who had a more southern English accent were better at identifying southern English speech in noise.},

The present study employed a polyclonal antibody to characterize the distribution of trk-immunoreactive neurons within the nonhuman primate brain. Both young adult and aged cebus and rhesus monkeys displayed trk-immunoreactive neurons within all subdivisions of the basal forebrain. Colocalization studies revealed that between 66\% and 76\% of trk-immunoreactive basal forebrain neurons also expressed immunoreactivity for the low-affinity p75 NGF receptor, an excellent marker for cholinergic basal forebrain cells. In this experiment, most single-labeled basal forebrain neurons contained only trk immunoreactivity, whereas 4\% of basal forebrain neurons expressed only the low-affinity p75 NGF receptor. Scattered trk-immunoreactive neurons also were observed within the caudate nucleus and putamen. Although dual-localization studies with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were not performed, striatal neurons codistributed with ChAT-immunoreactive cells, and both types of cells were similar in size and morphology. This suggests that trk immunoreactivity is expressed within cholinergic interneurons within the primate striatum. Finally, lightly stained trk-immunoreactive neurons were observed within the stratum oriens of the hippocampal formation and within the hypothalamus. These data indicate that both cholinergic and, possibly, noncholinergic forebrain neurons express the protein for the high-affinity trk receptor, which transduces the signal mediating the trophic effects of neurotrophins. In addition, the pattern of trk immunoreactivity was preserved in two aged (26 and 29 years old) rhesus monkeys, suggesting that the expression of trk, for the most part, is sustained throughout the lifetime of the organism.},

This representation of a relationship in a single measurement by means of angle calculation is a methodological innovation for the sociophonetic enterprise. A value specifying the geometric relationship between two vowel positions is precise and replicable, as well as abstract enough to be comparable across data sets. Differences between 'phonetic' and 'sociolinguistic' stances on the interpretation of acoustic vowel data in formant plots and the issue of suitable vowel normalisation procedures for sociophonetics will also be discussed.},

	title = {The phonological dimension of grammatical markedness},
	abstract = {This dissertation explores the correlation between grammatical markedness
and the phonological properties of outputs inflected for morpho-syntactic
categories on a grammatical markedness hierarchy. The main claim
made in the thesis is that, under otherwise similar phonological
conditions, outputs carrying specifications for a marked member (g)
of a given grammatical category (G) can license a given type of marked
phonological structure (M) to an extent that is equal or greater
than outputs inflected for the unmarked category. I label this generalization
'Marked in the Marked' (MIM). Within the theoretical framework assumed
for the dissertation (Optimality Theory, Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004),
I propose that the universal repository of constraints (CON) be enriched
so as to include a family of formal licensing constraints LICENSE(M,g)
that license marked phonological structure (M) in output words that
carry the morpho-syntactic specifications of the marked member (g)
of G. I propose that the licensing constraint is functionally grounded
in the sense that the marked value g is determined by recourse to
language use factors such as frequency of occurrence in discourse.
Only licensing constraints for marked values g are allowed in CON.
The content of the notions 'grammatical markedness' and 'phonological
markedness' is reviewed and criteria for the two kinds of markedness
are discussed. Manifestations of phonological markedness and their
grammatical category underpinnings are discussed at the following
levels: prosodic (Old Saxon), segmental (Romanian) and phonotactic
(Mayak). For all these cases, the Marked in the Marked constraint
schema (in interaction with other relevant constraints) and the factorial
typology associated with it are shown to make the correct empirical
predictions. A functional grounding account of the MIM effects discussed
in the dissertation is laid out. MIM phenomena are assumed to arise
from factors of economy in language production in the sense that
confining marked phonological structure to less frequent, grammatically
marked forms contributes to minimization of speaker's effort. Also,
the presence of marked phonological material in outputs inflected
for the marked grammatical category may have certain advantages in
language perception, retrieval and acquisition.},

This specific arrangement of segments within the syllable has been attributed in the previous literature to the principle of sonority sequencing, which relegates segments low in sonority towards syllable margins (see Hooper 1976; Kiparsky 1979, 1981; Steriade 1982; Selkirk 1984; Levin 1985; Clements 1990).},

the following consonant, the presence of a word boundary and, to

reduced categorically (deleted), while sporadic gradient reduction
of gestures is also observed. We further compare the results for
coronals to our previous findings on the assimilation of labials,
discussing implications of the results for grammatical models of
phonological/phonetic competence. The results suggest that speakers'

An alternative proposal analyzes the initial vowel of suffixes that condition shortening as a floating matrix, ie, a defective segment invisible to syllabification \& vocalized after syllabic shortening. Shortening is therefore conditioned by closed syllables. Formalizations in skeletal, moraic, \& lexical phonology models are discussed. Evidence of American English flapping \& RP tapping, dark /l/, \& syllabic consonants is adduced to show that ambisyllabification is necessary to describe English \& is independent from shortening.

	abstract = {This article presents a sociolinguistic investigation of a rapidly expanding innovation in the UK, glottal replacement, in a variety spoken in northeast Scotland. Quantitative analysis of the form shows a dramatic change in apparent time: from a minority variant in the older generation to a full 90 per cent use in the younger generation. Further analysis of the constraints on use provide a detailed snapshot of how this variant moves through social and linguistic space. Males use higher rates of the non-standard form in the older generations but this constraint is neutralised in the younger generations as the form increases. Styleshifting according to interlocutor also neutralises through time. While these results across the social constraints are in line with previous analyses, the linguistic constraints differ in this variety. In contrast to most other varieties, intervocalic contexts such as bottle show high rates of glottal replacement. Moreover, word-internal foot-initial contexts (e.g. sometimes ) also frequently allow the non-standard variant, despite this being rare in other dialects. Although glottal replacement is largely considered to be a ‘torchbearer’ of geographical diffusion, this in-depth analysis suggests that different varieties may have different pathways of change in the rapid transition from [t] to [ʔ] throughout the UK.},

	title = {The vocalization of /l/ in \{{Philadelphia}\}},
	abstract = {The vocalization of /l/ results from the loss of contact between the
tongue and the palate in the articulation of the liquid, which produces
a glide that is acoustically similar to \{u\}. This phenomenon is documented
in a number of languages in word-final and syllable-final position,
and it has also been reported in a few dialects of American English.
The case of /l/-vocalization in Philadelphia is unusual in that the
vocalized variant occurs variably in every position in the word where
/l/ can occur. This includes not only word- and syllable-final position,
but also intervocalic, as in "really," syllable-initial clusters,
as in "play," and word- and syllable-initial, as in "like" and "quickly."
This study attempts to clarify the linguistic and social factors
which condition /l/-vocalization in Philadelphia and to determine
whether the variation is showing evidence of change in progress.

The data were collected from tape-recorded interviews of 54 native
Philadelphia men and women representing a range of ethnic and socioeconomic
groups, ages, and neighborhoods in the city. (Blacks were not included
in the study.) A total of more than 23,000 occurrences of the variable
were collected. Most of these were coded for seven linguistic factors,
speaking style, and five social factors. Multivariable analysis (VARBRUL2)
was used to analyze the data. Initially the occurrences of (l) in
each position in the word were analyzed separately, and later the
tokens in certain pairs of environments were merged and reanalyzed
to determine whether they behaved the same or differently.

The bulk of the analysis was performed on postvocalic final and intervocalic
/l/ since /l/-vocalization is most frequent in these positions: in
the present sample, it occurs in both environments 19\% of the time.

The linguistic conditioning of the variation for the most part follows
straightforwardly from the predicted effects of articulatory factors.
Some exceptions are examined in detail.

The social distribution shows a pattern of interaction indicating
that /l/-vocalization in Philadelphia is receding. Although the overt
stigmatization attached to vocalized /l/ is minimal, it appears that
the upper working/lower middle class is leading a movement away from
the use of vocalized /l/ in final and intervocalic positions.

A survey of the use of vocalized /l/ was also carried out using data
from tape-recorded interviews from communities all over the United
States. The results of this study suggest that /l/-vocalization was
an innovation of the Midland dialect region, with Philadelphia as
the most likely point of origin. It has spread west through and beyond
this area, as far as California; it has moved up the East Coast at
a low level of frequency; and it has made some inroads into the northern
cities, including Rochester, Cleveland, and Detroit, though there
was no evidence of it in Chicago. The least amount of vocalized /l/
was found in the South.},

At each testing session, subjects were recorded reading a set of experimental words and a short passage. Subjects also completed two perceptual tasks; they chose best exemplar locations for vowels embedded in either northern or southern English accented carrier sentences and identified words in noise spoken with either a northern or southern English accent. The results demonstrated that subjects at a late stage in their language development, early adulthood, changed their spoken accent after attending university. There were no reliable changes in perception over time, but there was evidence for a between-subjects link between production and perception; subjects chose similar vowels to the ones they produced, and subjects who had a more southern English accent were better at identifying southern English speech in noise.},

	abstract = {This article reviews Lexical Phonology, a theory of rules and derivations. Rules are of three types: cyclic rules, postcyclic rules, and postlexical rules. Various diag-nostic properties of rules are discussed, including the phonological cycle, word vs. phrase domain application, the Strict Cyclicity Constraint, derived environments, the Structure Preservation Constraint, lexical conditioning, and the interaction of phonology and morphology. The data are drawn from English, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Slovak. Lexical Phonology grew out of The Sound Pattern of English (SPE hereafter; Chomsky and Halle 1968) as a refinement of the structure of the phono-logical and the morphological components of the grammar. The roots of Lexical Phonology go back to Kiparsky (1973), Mascaró (1976), Halle (1978), and Rubach (1981). The opening paper for the theory was Kiparsky's (1982) 'From Cyclic to Lexical Phonology'. The lexical framework inspired the research of the 1980s and 1990s, as I explain in Section 6. Today, Lexical Phonology remains the source of insight especially in two lines of pho-nological investigation: Distributed Morphology (DM) and Derivational Optimality Theory (DOT). It is for this reason that the theory merits attention in spite of the fact that it is no longer practised in the form as described in this article. Lexical Phonology is a theory of rules and derivations. It is a theory of rules, because it claims that rules are universally of three types: cyclic rules, postcyclic rules, and postlexical rules. It is a theory of derivations, because it claims that the way in which the derivation is organized is crucial to phonological analysis. In particular, some derivations proceed in steps, called cycles, while others do not. Non-cyclic derivations are of two types: word level derivations and postsyntactic derivations. Lexical Phonology is an extreme embodiment of Chomsky's (1970) lexicalist hypothesis. It is extreme because it claims that all word formation, including inflection, takes place in the lexicon.

While most cases of linguistic diffusion, particularly of African American English, are found in speakers with a positive affiliation with the source dialect (e.g., Bucholtz, 1999; Cutler, 1999; Fix, 2010), here the white adopters of (TH)-fronting exhibit overtly hostile attitudes toward black neighbors. I argue that (TH)-fronting has been adopted as an index of street or masculinity by the white speakers in this study. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the phonological constraints on borrowed (TH)-fronting have been restricted and simplified from the constraints in the source dialect. Finally, I discuss how hostile interactions may play a role in language change, allowing change in dialects not only to proceed in tandem across unexpected boundaries (e.g., Milroy \& Milroy, 1985), but also to be directly diffused across hostile boundaries.},

	abstract = {While some sound changes occur in environments defined in purely phonological terms, others may become sensitive to morphological boundaries. In this paper, we investigate the phonetic nature of this latter diachronic development: does it happen through small gradient increments, or is there a categorical shift from one allophone to another? We focus on GOOSE-fronting and /l/-darkening in Southern British English, the interaction of which is sensitive to morphological boundaries. Relatively retracted realisations of the vowel and dark realisations of the /l/ appear before a morpheme boundary, even when a vowel follows (e.g. fool-ing), whereas in monomorphemic words (e.g. hula), there is more /uː/-fronting, and the /l/ is relatively lighter. We analyse the phonetic realisation of such pairs as hula vs. fool-ing in 20 speakers of Southern British English using both acoustic and articulatory (ultrasound) instrumental methods. All the speakers express the morphological contrast in some way, although effect sizes vary dramatically. For some speakers, the contrast involves subtle articulatory differences without any clear acoustic consequences, whereas other speakers show robust differences employing multiple phonetic correlates. We therefore argue that the hula{\textasciitilde}fool-ing contrast would be misrepresented if analysed in terms of a small number of either /uː/ or /l/ allophonic categories. Instead, we interpret the results as supporting the predictions of phonological frameworks that incorporate phonetically-gradient morphologisation.},

Based on 106 listeners' responses to these stimuli, I find that intervocalic [z] indexes a lower social status for all speakers but also yields higher ratings of confidence, niceness, localness, and masculinity for male speakers. Given female speakers' limited ability to evoke positive social meanings associated with [z], I argue that accessibility to the indexical field (Eckert, 2008) conditions men's and women's differential treatment of variation. Offering a satisfying explanation for the gender paradox (Labov, 2001:261-293), this work concludes that women agentively eschew nonstandard variants that result in no positive social gains but lead linguistic innovation when their access to the indexical field is unobstructed.},

In this paper, we investigate the phonetic nature of this latter diachronic development: does it happen through small gradient increments, or is there a categorical shift from one allophone to another? We focus on GOOSE-fronting and /l/-darkening in Southern British English, the interaction of which is sensitive to morphological boundaries. Relatively retracted realisations of the vowel and dark realisations of the /l/ appear before a morpheme boundary, even when a vowel follows (e.g. fool-ing), whereas in monomorphemic words (e.g. hula), there is more /uː/-fronting, and the /l/ is relatively lighter. We analyse the phonetic realisation of such pairs as hula vs. fool-ing in 20 speakers of Southern British English using both acoustic and articulatory (ultrasound) instrumental methods. All the speakers express the morphological contrast in some way, although effect sizes vary dramatically. For some speakers, the contrast involves subtle articulatory differences without any clear acoustic consequences, whereas other speakers show robust differences employing multiple phonetic correlates. We therefore argue that the hula{\textasciitilde}fool-ing contrast would be misrepresented if analysed in terms of a small number of either /uː/ or /l/ allophonic categories. Instead, we interpret the results as supporting the predictions of phonological frameworks that incorporate phonetically-gradient morphologisation.},

This suggests that speakers' intentions or norms, while they may shift only gradually, can do so more easily than their productions. Two groups of 'mobile' speakers—adults who grew up in one dialect area and moved to another, and children who acquired one dialect at home and another in the community—showed the opposite pattern: spontaneous speech approximated the dialect of the second community more closely than did word-list productions. Analysis of these speakers' low back vowels (the LOT and THOUGHT word classes) also suggest that most adults can at least partially learn a vowel distinction as well as a merger, though children are able to do both things more quickly and completely.},

	abstract = {Dialectologists in England have concentrated on the speech of small and relatively isolated rural communities (see, for example, Orton and Dieth, I962: Introduction, I4). Other linguists and phoneticians concerned with the English of England have almost without exception described Standard English and the form of pronunciation they call, using an established but less than happy term, 'Received Pronunciation' (Jones, I967:xvii). Yet the English of most English (and English-speaking Welsh) people is neither RP Standard English nor a rural dialect. The vast mass of urban working-class and lower-middle-class speakers use a pronunciation nearer to RP, and lexical and grammatical forms much nearer to Standard English, than the archaic rural dialects recorded by the dialec- tologists. Yet their speech diverges in many ways from what is described as standard. The purpose of this article, which must be regarded as preliminary and tentative, is to sketch the principal phonetic variables among such local, mainly urban, forms of English.' It is the task of anyone concerned with the description of these 'accents' of English to investigate whatever phonetic variables can be identified and to establish their correlation with the non-linguistic variables of age, social standing and education, and geographical provenance.

	url = {http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol18/iss2/3},
	abstract = {The current study analyzes 4,000 tokens of Spanish coda /s/ from both a discrete and continuous perspective. The data, drawn from the Otheguy-Zentella Corpus of Spanish in New York, are described categorically in terms of the presence or absence of frication, i.e., in terms of s-deletion. Data are also described in terms of two instrumentally measured gradient parameters: frication duration (in milliseconds) and spectral center of gravity (COG, in Hz). Results suggest that a unified methodology does more than simply increase the descriptive breadth of the analysis. Instead, it shows that certain patterns of variation are opaque at exclusively categorical or gradient levels. With respect to social factors, the data suggest that Spanish speakers born and raised in NYC produce /s/ in significantly different ways than their recently arrived counterparts from Latin America. The cause of these differences is very likely to be language and dialect contact. That is, generational shifts in /s/ production are due to native New Yorkers' extensive experience with English and also with multiple varieties of Spanish. However, it is impossible to draw this conclusion purely on the basis of either deletion rates or measurements of the spectrotemporal properties of fricatives. Instead it is necessary to examine both kinds of data to properly assess these trends. Similar findings emerge with respect to linguistic factors. While some linguistic factors robustly constrain deletion rates as well as variation in frication duration and COG, the predictive power of other factors is restricted to either the discrete or continuous domain of variability. For example, the morphemic status of /s/ strongly conditions the presence or absence of frication. However, this same constraint has no bearing on either the duration or COG of fricative moments. Such asymmetries in predictive power suggest that the conditioning effects of linguistic factors can be restricted to specific domains of variability. The theoretical implications of this finding are substantial, indicating that models of socio-phonetic variation that do not distinguish and relate discrete and continuous levels of expression may misconstrue the relative contributions of explanatory factors.},

Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers \& Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal α in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.},

Rather, they predict a relationship between decomposition \& the relative frequency of the derived form \& the base. This paper argues that such a relative frequency effect does, indeed, exist. First, the results of a simple experiment demonstrate that subjects perceive derived forms that are more frequent than their bases to be significantly less complex than matched counterparts that are less frequent than their bases. \& second, dictionary calculations reveal that derived forms that are more frequent than their bases are significantly more likely to display symptoms of semantic drift than derived forms containing higher-frequency bases. High-frequency forms, however, are no more prone to semantic drift than low-frequency forms. These results provide evidence that it is relative frequency, rather than absolute frequency, that affects the decomposability of morphologically complex words. A low-frequency form is likely to be nontransparent if it is composed of even-lower-frequency parts. \& a high-frequency form may be highly decomposable if the base word it contains is higher frequency still. 10 Tables, 3 Figures, 66 References.

	abstract = {Linguistic variation has consistently been found to have social meaning in its association with the status and stance of speakers in the context of interaction. This indexical function of variation can contribute to the advancement of ongoing linguistic change. Style shifting in individual sociolinguistic interviews is an indirect indication of social meaning, but the clearest demonstrations are found in studies of speakers in a range of social contexts. We explore and clarify the nature of social meaning in variation, and its relation to linguistic change. Phonological variables are most readily adapted to convey social meaning by their frequency, flexibility and freedom from referential functions. After providing several kinds of evidence of social meaning in phonological variation, we argue that meaning accrues specifically to concrete sounds – to phonetic elements – and not to the phonological structures in which those sounds participate. Mergers, near mergers, splits, chain shifts and parallel shifts are not generally objects of social perception, conscious or unconscious, and are motivated by more abstract principles of change.},

However, previous work on the SVS generally limits its focus to steady state formant measures. Possible links between these shifts and dynamic trajectory distinctions have largely been unexplored despite widespread recognition that Southern vowels are dynamic in nature. The current article uses data from three Southern states (Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia) to ask to what extent does spectral onset position (the typical measure of SVS participation) correlate with internal spectral dynamics in the SVS. Analysis methods include a series of spectral measures (vector length, trajectory length, spectral rate of change and vector angle), which capture vowel inherent dynamics and vowel directionality. Results support the utility of looking at dynamic measures to better understand the fuller extent of vowel changes that occur with the SVS and lend support to recent calls to include nonstatic measures in sociophonetic analyses more generally.},

We develop the mathematical background for these variable rules, which were introduced by Labov, and we apply the theory and methodology to examples from Spanish, French, and English. The data consist of relative frequencies of rule applica- tion for different types of input string, and they provide a check on the frequencies predicted by variable rules. This study supports the hypothesis that the various features in rule structural descriptions tend to act independently, in the statistical sense, on rule probabilities. The analytic framework for variable rules is easily and naturally extend- able to take into account the effect of sociolinguistic and stylistic features on application frequencies.},

Canadians in New York also show topic- A nd stance-based shift in (oh): (oh)s are higher when expressing positive affect or closeness to New York City and lower when expressing negative affect or distance.

Getting started with Bayesian modeling can be challenging, especially when one is trying to model one's own (often unique) data. It is difficult to see how one can apply general principles described in textbooks to one's own specific research problem. We address this barrier to using Bayesian methods by providing three detailed examples, with source code to allow easy reproducibility.

The present study employed a polyclonal antibody to characterize the distribution of trk-immunoreactive neurons within the nonhuman primate brain. Both young adult and aged cebus and rhesus monkeys displayed trk-immunoreactive neurons within all subdivisions of the basal forebrain. Colocalization studies revealed that between 66\% and 76\% of trk-immunoreactive basal forebrain neurons also expressed immunoreactivity for the low-affinity p75 NGF receptor, an excellent marker for cholinergic basal forebrain cells. In this experiment, most single-labeled basal forebrain neurons contained only trk immunoreactivity, whereas 4\% of basal forebrain neurons expressed only the low-affinity p75 NGF receptor. Scattered trk-immunoreactive neurons also were observed within the caudate nucleus and putamen. Although dual-localization studies with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were not performed, striatal neurons codistributed with ChAT-immunoreactive cells, and both types of cells were similar in size and morphology. This suggests that trk immunoreactivity is expressed within cholinergic interneurons within the primate striatum. Finally, lightly stained trk-immunoreactive neurons were observed within the stratum oriens of the hippocampal formation and within the hypothalamus. These data indicate that both cholinergic and, possibly, noncholinergic forebrain neurons express the protein for the high-affinity trk receptor, which transduces the signal mediating the trophic effects of neurotrophins. In addition, the pattern of trk immunoreactivity was preserved in two aged (26 and 29 years old) rhesus monkeys, suggesting that the expression of trk, for the most part, is sustained throughout the lifetime of the organism.},

1. grammatical
Past tense 
2. following consonant
Approaches vary: some have consonant, pause, vowel; this study also liquid, glide

3. preceding
More probable after S
Labov et al(1968) obstruent vs. sonorant
Wolfram (1969) fricative, stop, sonorant
Present Study: sibilant, non sib fricative, nasal, stop, lateral

4. stress - unstressed syllables are more likely to delete (not considered in this study, seeFasold 1972)

5. speech rate - as expected, more deletion in faster rates

6-7. Length, complexity: text {\textgreater} past

8. style - more commonly informal

9. social factors: see Wolfram (1969) age, sex race social class racial isolation

Findings
New York high before pause than before vowel
Philadelphia, the other way round

Labov's constraint: consonant, liquid, glide, vowel 
Pause is functionally outside of this system, and is therefore subject to differ between varieties},

Speakers who have the distinction between the "clear" [l] and the "dark" [5] also
show the following contrast between compounds and phrases:
(20) a. a whale edition vs. the whale and the shark
[l] [5]
b. the seal office vs. the seal offered a doughnut
[I] [5]

Clearly, the generalization is that in compounds word-final /1!b ecomes the onset of the
following vowel-initial word. More formally, I-Resyllabification takes place in compound.

l-Resyllabification applies at stratum 4 because it affects not only compounds but also
V + ing forms such as dea[l]ing, whee[l]ing, etc. l-Resyllabification applies before and
thus bleeds l-Velarization, which applies at the postlexical stratum. Across words in
phrases (which are concatenated at the postlexical stratum) there is no resyllabification
of I in English..},

	abstract = {This paper presents an empirical analysis of /l/-darkening in English, using ultrasound tongue imaging data from five varieties spoken in the UK. The analysis of near 500 tokens from five participants provides hitherto absent instrumental evidence demonstrating that speakers may display both categorical allophony of light and dark variants, and gradient phonetic effects coexisting in the same grammar. Results are interpreted through the modular architecture of the life cycle of phonological processes, whereby a phonological rule starts its life as a phonetically driven gradient process, over time stabilizing into a phonological process at the phrase level, and advancing through the grammar. Not only does the life cycle make predictions about application at different levels of the grammar, it also predicts that stabilized phonological rules do not replace the phonetic processes from which they emerge, but typically coexist with them, a pattern which is supported in the data. Overall, this paper demonstrates that variation in English /l/ realization has been underestimated in the existing literature, and that we can observe phonetic, phonological, and morphosyntactic conditioning when accounting for a representative range of phonological environments across varieties.},

After a brief introduction comparing the current situation with that of 15 years ago, I look more closely at definitions of WEs and ELF. Then follows an overview of relevant developments in WEs and ELF research during the past 15 years, along with a more detailed discussion of some key research projects and any controversies they have aroused. I then address the implications of WEs/ELF research for TESOL vis-à-vis English language standards and standard English, and the longstanding native versus nonnative teacher debate. Finally, I assess the consensus on WEs and ELF that is emerging both among researchers and between researchers and language teaching professionals. The article concludes by raising a number of questions that remain to be investigated in future research.},

We present apparent-time data from a community of Cockney speakers, rehoused from London to Essex in the 1950s. Our interest is in tracking the potential loss of a traditional Cockney feature, the PRICE-MOUTH crossover. We find that the crossover is reversing in apparent time, showing an abrupt change towards regional standard in speakers under 28 years of age, which we link to historical policy changes, and a following shift to social class attitude. We also find that while the formant values shift noticeably in apparent time, the changes largely preserve the trajectory shape.},

A dynamic acoustic analysis of the first three formants across the duration of the rhyme (vowel+liquid sequence) shows significant effects of preceding and following phonetic context on the course and trajectories of the formant tracks. We also find raising of F3 for /r/ in speakers who were born and recorded more recently; F2 is lowering for /l/ in the same speakers. Comparison of F2 across the two word-final liquids suggests that /r/ is clearer than /l/ for this Scottish dialect; interestingly the polarity in resonance between /r/ and /l/ is increasing over time.},

In the spirit of optimal control theory, we propose that recognition requirements are balanced against requirements such as rate of speech and style, as well as movement costs, to yield (near-)optimal planned surface timing patterns; additional factors may influence the implementation of that plan. In the second part of the paper, we discuss theories of timing control in models of speech production and motor control. We present three types of evidence that support models of speech production that involve extrinsic timing. These include (i) increasing variability with increases in interval duration, (ii) evidence that speakers refer to and plan surface durations, and (iii) independent timing of movement onsets and offsets.},

	abstract = {Artificial analogues of natural-language phonological patterns can often be learned in the lab from small amounts of training or exposure. The difficulty of a featurally-defined pattern has been hypothesized to be affected by two main factors, its formal structure (the abstract logical relationships between the defining features) and its phonetic substance (the concrete phonetic interpretation of the pattern). This paper, the second of a two-part series, reviews the experimental literature on phonetic substance, which is hypothesized to facilitate the acquisition of phonological patterns that resemble naturally-occurring phonetic patterns. The effects of phonetic substance on pattern learning turn out to be elusive and unreliable in comparison with the robust effects of formal complexity (reviewed in Part I). If natural-language acquisition is guided by the same inductive biases as are found in the lab, these results support a theory in which inductive bias shapes only the form, and channel bias shapes the content, of the sound patterns of the worlds languages. © 2012 The Authors.

	abstract = {Non-mobile individuals living in a community undergoing a linguistic change usually display a pattern of variation where citation styles are more advanced than naturalistic styles with respect to the change in progress. This suggests that speakers' intentions or norms, while they may shift only gradually, can do so more easily than their productions. Two groups of 'mobile' speakers—adults who grew up in one dialect area and moved to another, and children who acquired one dialect at home and another in the community—showed the opposite pattern: spontaneous speech approximated the dialect of the second community more closely than did word-list productions. Analysis of these speakers' low back vowels (the LOT and THOUGHT word classes) also suggest that most adults can at least partially learn a vowel distinction as well as a merger, though children are able to do both things more quickly and completely.},

Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) reveals that all the main effects analyzed are statistically significant and robustly influence tax compliance behavior. These results highlight the importance of obtaining a proper understanding of these factors for developing effective policies for increasing the level of compliance, and indicate that standard enforcement polices based on punishment alone should be supplemented by an information system that would acquaint tax payers with the compliance level of other tax payers; reinforce the concept of fairness of the tax system among tax payers; and develop programs that enhance and appeal to a taxpayer's moral conscience and reinforce social cohesion.},

Researchers have increasingly sought out elicitation tasks that have the benefits of tasks based on reading aloud (e.g., studying infrequently occurring variables; controlling for linguistic factors; eliciting the same lexical items across participants) while also eliciting styles more comparable to interview speech (see Drager 2018). Examples include the Map Task (Brown et al. 1984) and the Diapix task (Baker and Hazan 2011). Other researchers have turned instead to elicitation tasks that maximize ecological validity, taking themselves out of the recording context and training participants to collect field recordings (e.g., Podesva 2007; Sharma 2011). But how comparable is the speech elicited from each of these tasks? Building on results from previous research (Boyd et al. 2015; Hall-Lew and Boyd 2017) we consider three US English speakers' vowel productions from interviews, reading passages, 'Lab Tasks', and self-recordings. We suggest that both Lab Tasks and self-recordings have the potential to increase descriptive accuracy and indexical analysis in sociophonetic research.},

After a brief introduction comparing the current situation with that of 15 years ago, I look more closely at definitions of WEs and ELF. Then follows an overview of relevant developments in WEs and ELF research during the past 15 years, along with a more detailed discussion of some key research projects and any controversies they have aroused. I then address the implications of WEs/ELF research for TESOL vis-à-vis English language standards and standard English, and the longstanding native versus nonnative teacher debate. Finally, I assess the consensus on WEs and ELF that is emerging both among researchers and between researchers and language teaching professionals. The article concludes by raising a number of questions that remain to be investigated in future research.},

Examples include diphthongal formant trajectories and articulator trajectories observed using electromagnetic articulography. Traditional approaches for analyzing this type of data generally aggregate data over a certain timespan, or only include measurements at a fixed time point (e.g., formant measurements at the midpoint of a vowel). This paper discusses generalized additive modeling, a non-linear regression method which does not require aggregation or the pre-selection of a fixed time point. Instead, the method is able to identify general patterns over dynamically varying data, while simultaneously accounting for subject and item-related variability. An advantage of this approach is that patterns may be discovered which are hidden when data is aggregated or when a single time point is selected. A corresponding disadvantage is that these analyses are generally more time consuming and complex. This tutorial aims to overcome this disadvantage by providing a hands-on introduction to generalized additive modeling using articulatory trajectories from L1 and L2 speakers of English within the freely available R environment. All data and R code is made available to reproduce the analysis presented in this paper.},

Generalized additive mixed-models (GAMMs) are used for quantifying time-varying formant data, which allows the modelling of non-linearities in acoustic time series while simultaneously modelling speaker and word level variability in the data. These models are compared to single time-point analyses of lateral and vowel targets in order to determine what analysing formant dynamics can tell about dialect variation in speech acoustics. The results show that lateral targets exhibit robust differences between some positional contexts and also between dialects, with smaller differences present in vowel targets. The time-varying analysis shows that dialect differences frequently occur globally across the lateral and adjacent vowels. These results suggest a complex relationship between lateral and vowel targets and their coarticulatory dynamics, which problematizes straightforward claims about the realization of laterals and their adjacent vowels. These findings are further discussed in terms of hypotheses about positional and sociophonetic variation. In doing so, the utility of GAMMs for analysing time-varying multi-segmental acoustic signals is demonstrated, and the significance of the results for accounts of English lateral typology is highlighted.},

Yet, listeners are able to guess talker age more accurately than a binary distinction would imply, suggesting that acoustic characteristics of speech change continually and gradually throughout adulthood. We describe acoustic properties of vowels produced by eleven talkers based on naturalistic speech samples spanning a period of 28 years, from ages 21 to 49. We find that the position of vowels in F1/F2 space shifts towards the periphery with increasing talker age. Based on Generalized Additive Mixed Effects models, we show that this shift is not fully attributable to changes in vowel duration or to segmental context. We discuss the implications of our results for research on aging and speech, and for research in which durational shortening and spectral characteristics of vowels are assumed to reflect a unitary process of phonetic reduction.},

Replicating previous work in this paradigm, results showed robust false memory effects: that is, participants were more likely to (falsely) remember a critical item than a random intrusion. When the realization of /s/ was consistent across conditions (Experiment 1), false memory rates for varying versus non-varying words did not significantly differ. However, when the realization of /s/ varied between [s] and [h] in those positions which allow it (Experiment 2), false recognition rates for varying words like {\textless}em{\textgreater}busto {\textless}/em{\textgreater}were significantly higher than those for non-varying words like {\textless}em{\textgreater}sopa{\textless}/em{\textgreater}.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The effects of phonological context and speaking style are also examined. Patterns in the data are suggestive of dialect leveling, whereby localized speech variants become recessive and pronunciations typical of a wider geographical area are adopted. Within this broad pattern, however, there is evidence of parallelism be- tween the vowels in terms of the relative proportions of their variants across speaker groups. It is suggested that pressure to maintain the symmetrical structure of the underlying phonological system is guiding this process. Labov’s (1991, 1994) prin- ciples of chain shift are discussed in this connection. However, it is argued that the patterns in the data are more plausibly explained by considering the social signifi- cance of each variant instead of making reference to variants as socially neutral expressions of abstract phonological categories.},

	doi = {10.1044/2019_JSLHR-S-17-0414},
	abstract = {Purpose: The intelligibility of an accent strongly depends on the specific talker–listener pairing. To explore the causes of this phenomenon, we investigated the relationship between acoustic–phonetic similarity and accent intelligibility across native (1st language) and nonnative (2nd language) talker– listener pairings. We also used online measures to observe processing differences in quiet. Method: English (n = 16) and Spanish (n = 16) listeners heard Standard Southern British English, Glaswegian English, and Spanish-accented English in a speech recognition task (in quiet and noise) and an electroencephalogram task (quiet only) designed to assess phonological and lexical processing. Stimuli were drawn from the nonnative speech recognition sentences (Stringer \& Iverson, 2019). The acoustic–phonetic similarity between listeners’ accents and the 3 accents was calculated using the ACCDIST metric (Huckvale, 2004, 2007). Results: Talker–listener pairing had a clear influence on accent intelligibility. This was linked to the phonetic similarity of the talkers and the listeners, but similarity could not account for all findings. The influence of talker–listener pairing on lexical processing was less clear; the N400 effect was mostly robust to accent mismatches, with some relationship to intelligibility. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the influence of talker–listener pairing on intelligibility may be partly attributable to accent similarity in addition to accent familiarity. Online measures also show that differences in talker–listener accents can disrupt processing in quiet even where accents are highly intelligible.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {The regularity of sound change as set out by the scholars of the late nineteenth century is a fundamental principle of historical linguistics. The principle as recognized by the Neogrammarian linguists states that once a sound change has begun, it affects every word in the vocabulary that contains the sound in question. The principle has been disputed by many linguists and especially dialectologists, who argue that ‘every word has its own history’. This article demonstrates how the Neogrammarian principle operates in one prototypical change in progress, the raising of the mid front long vowel /ey/ before a consonant in Philadelphia English. Mixed-level regression analysis shows consistent phonetic constraints across the nineteenth century, with no effect of word frequency. The regularity of sound change is reflected in the common pattern of behavior of the most frequent words, those of moderate frequency, and words that occur only once in the corpus.},

Looking at prevoc (leap), postvoc (peal) and syllabic, also complex onsets and codas
Midwestern US speakers.

p.207: acoustic characteristics for /l/ were found to vary as a function of morphemic boundaries; for example, the /l/ in the word freely had formant frequency values like an initial /l/, and the /l/ in mealy was like a final /l/. 

p.211 the dorsum shape of /l/ is same/similar to the vowels [diagram]
in prevocalic /l/s the tongue tip (aka apex) always makes contact with the maxilla (alveolar ridge?)

p.212 in postvoc, tongue tip contact with maxilla is not always achieved
Faster rates of utterance means tongue tip contact is less likely to be made.
``The tongue dorsums appear to be shifted towards the positions of the preceding vowels in some articulations for fast utterance rate.''

p.214 Speakers were asked to produce phrases with syllable boundary preceding allophone e.g. peel. it and after allophone e.g. pee.l it. I'm pretty sure this is what they mean anyway. Weird. The result - coda /l/s are darker, same result as in monosyllables.

p.215 measured lip rounding by looking at protusion in /i/ and /u/ and comparing it to /l/. No lip rounding specifically linked to /l/, but depends on phonetic context. When adjacent to /u/ or FORCE it was like /u/-roundness, when next to others it was like /i/.
Consonant clusters show similar results to normal /l/s, with some phonetic coarticulation.

p.217 Some inter speaker variation (Subj C seems to have darker /l/s or higher dorsum contact)
Syllabic /l/s all show tongue tip contact. They got people to pronounce these words with a syllabic /l/ and with a normal final /l/ e.g. apple and appell, and found the /l/s were the same for dorsum position. But the lingual speed and velocity is more like initials. p.225 syllabic /l/s are acoustically different from initial and final, but need more study.

p.221 Tongue dorsum controur tends to stay the same (which is also similar to vowels), it's the tongue tip (and root) that varies.
Tongue dorsum position can be split into pre and post vocalic. Post is more posterior. Variation within these two allophone groups tends to vary systemicatically as a function of phonetic context and rate of artic.

p.222 ``The dorsum position in the word pool may correspond to the overdark /l/ described by Thomas, 1958 since the dorsum position was closest to the palate of all postvocs.''
Like Lehiste, the first and second formants are further apart in initial position than in final.
The frequency of F1 is closely related to the vertical position of the tongue (Stevens \& House, 1955), which was generally the same for light and dark in this study.
F2 is determined by the anteroposterior positioning of the tongue (Stevens \& House, 1955). The further forward the tongue posis, the higher F2 i.e. lighter /l/s have higher F2, greater diff.

p.223 peak velocity for TT movement was higher in light than darks (prevoc than post)
postvocs are more vowel-like, prevoc more consonantal},

	abstract = {How flexible is an individual’s accent during adulthood, and how does this flexibility relate to longer-term change? Previous work has found that accents are remarkably flexible in conversational interaction, but predominantly stable over years, leading to very different views of the role of individuals in community-level sound change. This article examines medium-term accent dynamics (days to months) by taking advantage of a ‘natural experiment’: A reality television show where contestants live in an isolated house for three months and are constantly recorded, forming a closed system where it is possible to both determine the dynamics of contestants’ speech from day to day and reason about the sources of any observed changes. We build statistical models to examine time dependence in five phonetic variables within individuals, in 14.5 hours of spontaneous speech from twelve English-speaking contestants. We find that time dependence in pronunciation is ubiquitous over the medium term: large daily fluctuations in pronunciation are the norm, while longer-term change over weeks to months occurs in a minority of cases. These patterns mirror the conflicting findings of previous work and suggest a possible bridge between the two. We argue that time dependence in phonetic variables is influenced by contrast between sounds, as well as systematic differences between speakers in how malleable their accents are over time; however, we find only limited evidence for convergence in individuals’ accents. Our results have implications for theories of the role of individuals in sound change, and suggest that medium-term pronunciation dynamics are a fruitful direction for future work.},

	abstract = {This article presents data on the acquisition of the low back vowel contrast by native speakers of Canadian English who have moved as adults to the New York City region, examining how these speakers who natively possess a single low back vowel category have acquired the low back vowel distinction of the new ambient dialect. The speakers show remarkable first dialect stability with respect to their low back vowel system, even after many years of new dialect exposure: in minimal pair contexts, nearly all of the speakers continue to produce and perceive a single vowel category. However, in word list and conversational contexts, the majority of speakers exhibit a small but significant phonetic difference between words like cot and caught, reflecting the separation of these word classes in the new dialect to which they are exposed; moreover, the realization of these words shows frequency effects consistent with a lexically gradual divergence of the two vowels. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of phonological representation and change, as well as their methodological implications for the study of mergers-and splits-in-progress. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

Reform initiatives emphasize the benefits of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices; however, adoption across the psychology literature is unknown. Estimating the prevalence of such practices will help to gauge the collective impact of reform initiatives, track progress over time, and calibrate future efforts. To this end, we manually examined a random sample of 250 psychology articles published between 2014 and 2017. Over half of the articles were publicly available (154/237, 65\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = [59\%, 71\%]); however, sharing of research materials (26/183; 14\%, 95\% CI = [10\%, 19\%]), study protocols (0/188; 0\%, 95\% CI = [0\%, 1\%]), raw data (4/188; 2\%, 95\% CI = [1\%, 4\%]), and analysis scripts (1/188; 1\%, 95\% CI = [0\%, 1\%]) was rare. Preregistration was also uncommon (5/188; 3\%, 95\% CI = [1\%, 5\%]). Many articles included a funding disclosure statement (142/228; 62\%, 95\% CI = [56\%, 69\%]), but conflict-of-interest statements were less common (88/228; 39\%, 95\% CI = [32\%, 45\%]). Replication studies were rare (10/188; 5\%, 95\% CI = [3\%, 8\%]), and few studies were included in systematic reviews (21/183; 11\%, 95\% CI = [8\%, 16\%]) or meta-analyses (12/183; 7\%, 95\% CI = [4\%, 10\%]). Overall, the results suggest that transparency and reproducibility-related research practices were far from routine.

Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back up-gliding vowels /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features of local phonology, tense /aeh/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education. Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadel-phia vowel system can be understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in com-mon with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here as subject to phonological generaliza-tions but driven by social evaluation as features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community.*},

For example, the secondsyllable stressed word sixTEEN will be produced as SIXteen in the phrase SIXteen CANdles. Using pseudo-words in different rhythmic contexts, we demonstrate that stress clash resolution has a strong perceptual component and can be an auditory illusion. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to misattribute stress in a clash condition (sixTEEN heard as SIXteen in sixTEEN CANdles) than in isolation (sixTEEN) or in a non-clash condition (sixTEEN caNALS). In Experiment 2, we failed to find support for the hypothesis that nuclear stress drove these ratings.

This paper investigates the relationship between these two types of shifts by asking whether speakers with substantial second dialect exposure change their pronunciation more when the topic changes in a regionally meaningful way compared to speakers with less exposure. Specifically, topic-based shifts on three phonological variables that differ between British and US English are investigated in native speakers of both dialects as a function of the migrant status of the speaker. Experience matters in that speakers only shift between variants in their repertoire, and expatriates have acquired some second dialect features that nonmigrants do not have. However, it does not appear that more exposure to, or increased rates of usage of a variant leads to more topic-based shifting toward that variant. These findings, interpreted within the existing literature, suggest that topic-based shifts are driven primarily by stereotypical sociolinguistic representations.},

We consider four methodological approaches to representing and assessing vowel difference: Euclidean distances, mixed effects regression modeling (Nycz 2013), the Pillai-Bartlett trace (Hay, Warren, \& Drager 2006), and the spectral overlap assessment metric (Wassink 2006). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method and compare them by applying all of them to three different data sets, each of which contains low vowel data from speakers whose status with respect to a vowel contrast may not be clear-cut: realizations of COT and CAUGHT in San Francisco, California; COT and CAUGHT among Canadians in the New York City region; and TRAP and BATH among Scots who work in Southern England.

	abstract = {processes of cognition; writing, as a technology evolved only within the past few thousand years and hence clearly a cultural rather than biological endowment, seemed accordingly less interesting than spoken language. Large misunderstandings of the nature of non-European scripts were rife. As recently as 1963 the distinguished anthropologist Jack Goody claimed that the non-alphabetic Chinese script (the vehicle of one of the world's greatest civilizations for three thousand years) was a limited system, which was incapable of expressing a complete range of ideas and hindered the adoption of standards of logic usual in "literate" societies (by which Goody meant societies using an alphabet). The Maya script of Central America has been recognized since its decipherment as the clearest case anywhere of a writing system which developed entirely independently of the ultimate Middle Eastern ancestors of European writing; until his death in 1975 the influential Mayanist Eric Thompson continued to insist against the decipherers that the system was not writing at all, but consisted only of stylized illustrations of Maya mythology. Happily, in recent decades things have changed. The study of writing is acknowledged now as a valid branch of linguistics alongside its other branches. Globalization has led Westerners to be less credulous about absurd misrepresentations of alien systems. The claim that different human languages all reflect an innate universal grammar looks less plausible to linguists today than it once did, and if languages are products of culture rather than biology then there is no reason to ignore written languages merely because they are newer cultural developments than their spoken counterparts. Writing may be a newish form of language, but in the circumstances of modern life it is a very important one. The main difficulty in placing the study of writing systems on a scientific footing, arguably, is not nowadays lack of good information about non-European scripts, but the fewness of independent examples. There are thousands of spoken languages in the world, falling into dozens, perhaps hundreds, of apparently unrelated families,},

The Study uses existing data sets of vowel formant data from two varieties of English, Received Pronunciation and Aberdeen English (northeast Scotland).

Forty-eight speakers were analysed within a Labovian framework in relation to the goose vowel (long /u/or /uw/). Over 4000 tokens were analysed acoustically using PRAAT and compared via vowel normalisation procedures based on Watt and Fabricius (2003). The results show that middle-class speakers of the three ethnicities are fronting the vowel, but in different ways. Black speakers show the greatest accommodation to erstwhile White norms.

Data on rhoticity from speakers of Bristol English are compared to 34 previous studies of rhoticity in varieties of English around the world. Constraints found to be consistent across varieties are also found to be consistent across speakers of Bristol English, whereas those that differ between varieties also differ between individuals, implying that only those which differ are truly part of the grammar, and that these are indeed disrupted by diffusion.},

This process is hypothesised to follow from the fragmentation of tight-knit urban communities that formed after large-scale immigration to Tyneside from elsewhere in the British Isles during the 18th and 19th centuries. High levels of dialect contact brought about by this influx are argued to have promoted the creation of an urban koiné, which in its contemporary form appears increasingly to be losing specifically local features. In addition to contact and mobility as agents of change, the history of unusually acute stigma attached to Tyneside speech should be considered. These and other social factors inform an analysis of the FACE and GOAT variables in the speech of 32 contemporary Tyneside English speakers of various ages, both sexes and from two social class groups.},

As a consequence, ableism in academia is endemic. However, to date no attempt has been made to theorise experiences of ableism in academia. Ableism in Academia provides an interdisciplinary outlook on ableism that is currently missing. Through reporting research data and exploring personal experiences, the contributors theorise and conceptualise what it means to be/work outside the stereotypical norm. The volume brings together a range of perspectives, including feminism, post-structuralism, such as Derridean and Foucauldian theory, crip theory and disability theory, and draw on the width and breadth of a number of related disciplines. Contributors use technicism, leadership, social justice theories and theories of embodiment to raise awareness and increase understanding of the marginalised; that is those academics who are not perfect. These theories are placed in the context of neoliberal academia, which is distant from the privileged and romanticised versions that exist in the public and internalised imaginations of academics, and used to interrogate aspects of identity, aspects of how disability is performed, and to argue that ableism is not just a disability issue. This timely collection of chapters will be of interest to researchers in Disability Studies, Higher Education Studies and Sociology, and to those researching the relationship between theory and personal experience across the Social Sciences.},

	abstract = {PREVIEW OF THE ARGUMENT 1 This paper is an exercise in 'amphichronic linguistics' (Kiparsky 2006, Bermúdez-Otero 2013). It illustrates the proposition that: • synchronic phonological universals (specially those concerning the modular architecture of grammar) delimit possible pathways of phonological change; • but the structure of particular phonological systems cannot itself be understood without reference to the diachronic pathways from which they emerge. 2 My evidence will be drawn from the history of phrase-level syllabification in English. I focus on the problem of the behaviour of word-final consonants immediately followed by a vowel across a grammatical word boundary: i.e. …C GWord ][ GWord V… 3 Using both internal linguistic evidence and data from poetic metre, Minkova (2003: ch. 4) shows that, • in Old English (OE), resyllabification was normally blocked by a process of []-insertion that avoided empty onsets in stressed syllables; σ σ s …C GWord ][ GWord    V… • in Middle English (ME), []-insertion became optional, enabling the rise of phrase-level resyllabification into onsets. σ σ …C GWord ][ GWord V… The problem, surprisingly, is how to follow up Minkova's narrative into the present! In Present-day English (PDE), word-final prevocalic consonants display both onset-like and coda-like properties; their syllabic affiliation is, therefore, a disputed issue. 4 Since Kahn (1976), a popular answer to the problem of the syllabic affiliation of word-final prevocalic consonants in PDE has been ambisyllabicity: σ σ …C GWord ][ GWord V…},

In doing so it provides a much-needed update to the existing RP-based descriptions by which the sound system of British English is still known to many around the world. The book opens with an account of the rise and fall of RP, before turning to a systematic analysis of the phonetic developments between RP and contemporary Standard Southern British (SSB) in vowels, consonants, stress, connected speech and intonation. Topics covered include the anti-clockwise vowel shift, the use of glottal stops, 'intrusive r', vocal fry and Uptalk. It concludes with a Mini Dictionary of well over 100 words illustrating the changes described throughout the book, and provides a chart of updated IPA vowel symbols. This book is an essential resource for anyone interested in British pronunciation and sound change, including academics in phonetics, phonology, applied linguistics and English language; trainers of English teachers; English teachers themselves; teachers of voice and accent coaches; and students in those areas.},

Building on recent developments in linguistics and social psychology, I investigate the extent to which stereotypical attitudes and beliefs about categories of speakers serve to enable the association of linguistic features with particular social meanings while simultaneously blocking others. My arguments are based on an analysis of listener perceptions of the intersecting categories of gender, sexuality, and social class among men in the UK. Using a modified matched-guise paradigm to test three category-relevant variables (mean pitch, spectral characteristics of /s/, and TH-fronting), I demonstrate how the perception of social meaning is governed by a combination of both attitudinal and cognitive factors. This finding is important because it illustrates the listener-dependent nature of sociolinguistic perception. Moreover, it also provides further empirical support for an understanding of social meaning as an emergent property of language-in-use.

To examine the role of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in mediating the behavioral and physiological responses associated with fear and anxiety, we used rhesus monkeys to assess the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the CeA. Behavioral and physiological responses of nine monkeys with bilateral CeA destruction (ranging from 46 to 98\%) were compared with five animals with asymmetric lesions (42-86.5\% destruction on the most affected side) and with 16 unoperated controls. Results suggest that similar to rodent species, the primate CeA plays a role in mediating fear- and anxiety-related behavioral and endocrine responses. Compared with controls and the asymmetric-lesion group, bilaterally lesioned monkeys displayed significantly less fear-related behavior when exposed to a snake and less freezing behavior when confronted by a human intruder. In addition, bilaterally lesioned monkeys had decreased levels of CSF corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), and both lesioned groups had decreased plasma ACTH concentrations. In contrast to these findings, patterns of asymmetric frontal brain electrical activity, as assessed by regional scalp EEG, did not significantly differ between control and lesioned monkeys. These findings suggest that in primates, the CeA is involved in mediating fear- and anxiety-related behavioral and pituitary-adrenal responses as well as in modulating brain CRF activity.},

Prior studies of British English have not found the morphological effect-more deletion in monomorphemic mist than past tense missed-commonly observed in American English. We find this effect in Manchester and provide evidence that the rise of glottal stop replacement in postsonorant position in British English (e.g., halt, aunt) may be responsible for the reduction in the strength of this effect in British varieties. Glottaling blocks deletion, and, because the vast majority of postsonorant tokens are monomorphemic, the higher rates of monomorpheme glottaling dampens the typical effect of deletion in this context. These findings indicate organization at a higher level of the grammar, while also showing overlaid effects of factors such as style and word frequency.},

We begin by replicating the sonority projection effects in a non-word acceptability study. Then we evaluate the extent to which sonority projection is predicted by existing computational models of phonotactics (Coleman \& Pierrehumbert 1997, Hayes \& Wilson 2008, inter alia). We show that a model based only on lexical statistics can explain sonority projection in English without a pre-existing sonority sequencing principle. To do this, a model must possess (i) a featural system supporting sonority-based generalisations, and (ii) a context representation including syllabification or equivalent information. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

In the U.S. South, the Southern vowel shift (SVS) and African American vowel shift (AAVS) affect not only vowels' relative positions but also their formant dynamics. Static characterizations of shifting, with a single pair of first and second formant values taken near vowels' midpoint, fail to capture this vowel-inherent spectral change, which can indicate dialect-specific diphthongization or monophthongization. Vowel-inherent spectral change is directly modeled to investigate how trajectories of front vowels /i eɪ ɪ ɛ/ differ across social groups in the 64-speaker Digital Archive of Southern Speech. Generalized additive mixed models are used to test the effects of two social factors, sex and ethnicity, on trajectory shape. All vowels studied show significant differences between men, women, African American and European American speakers. Results show strong overlap between the trajectories of /eɪ, ɛ/ particularly among European American women, consistent with the SVS, and greater vowel-inherent raising of /ɪ/ among African American speakers, indicating how that lax vowel is affected by the AAVS. Model predictions of duration additionally indicate that across groups, trajectories become more peripheral as vowel duration increases.},

	abstract = {Although formulated by Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog in 1968, the actuation problem has remained an unsolved problem in understanding sound change: if sound change is conceived as the accumulation of coarticulation, and coarticulation is widespread, how can some speech communities resist phonetic pressure to change? We present data from American English s-retraction that suggest a partial solution. S-retraction is the phenomenon in which is realized as an like sound, especially when it occurs in an cluster ('street' pronounced more like than like). The speech of English speakers judged not to exhibit s-retraction shows a large coarticulatory bias in the direction of retraction. Further, there is also substantial interspeaker variation in the extent of this bias. We propose that this interspeaker variation, coupled with the coarticulatory bias, facilitates the initiation of sound change. In this account, sound change begins when a listener accidentally interprets an extreme case of a phonetic effect as an articulatory target and then adjusts her own speech in response. This adoption of a new target requires phonetic variation that predates the change. Thus, sound change is predicted to be biased toward phonetic effects that exhibit interspeaker variability, and if sound change requires an accident that is rare, then sound change itself is correctly predicted to be rare as well. © Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2011.},

NZ participants were randomly assigned to either a Positive or Negative group, where they were either flattered or insulted by the Australian. Overall, the NZE speakers accommodated to the speech of the AuE speaker. The flattery/insult manipulation did not influence degree of accommodation, but accommodation was predicted by participants' scores on an Implicit Association Task that measured Australia and New Zealand biases. Participants who scored with a pro-Australia bias were more likely to accommodate to the speech of the AuE speaker. Social biases about how a participant feels about a speaker predicted the extent of accommodation. These biases are, crucially, simultaneously automatic and social.

The tools used in the present study were developed for use with Mainstream American English, but we demonstrate that their forced alignment functionality nonetheless performs extremely well on a range of British varieties, encompassing both careful and casual speech. Where phone boundary placement is concerned, substantial errors in alignment occur infrequently, and although small displacements between aligner-placed and human-placed phone boundaries are found regularly, these will rarely have a significant effect on measurements of interest for the researcher. We demonstrate that gross phone boundary placement errors, when they do arise, are particularly likely to be introduced in fast speech or with varieties that are radically different from Mainstream American English (e.g. Scots). We also observe occasional problems with phonetic transcription. Overall, we advise that, although forced alignment software is highly reliable and improving continuously, human confirmation is needed to correct errors which can displace entire stretches of speech. Nevertheless, sociolinguists can be assured that the output of these tools is generally highly accurate for a wide range of varieties.},

Data elicited via a picture-naming task reveal a robust effect of orthography on phonological transfer leading to non-target-like productions at the very beginning stages of second language acquisition. There is also strong evidence that condition of training and production as well as the type of grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence determine the quantity of transfer. The difference in the quantity of transfer between the individual grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences is explained in light of salience and frequency effects.

The present study analyses the speech of 122 speakers from Manchester in the North West of England. Although the vast majority of speakers exhibit no distinction between the foot and strut lexical sets in minimal-pair production and judgement tests, vowel height is correlated with socio-economic status: The higher the social class, the lower the strut vowel. Surprisingly, statistical models indicate that vowel class is a significant predictor of foot-strut in Manchester. This means that, for a speech community without the split, there remains an effect in the expected direction: Strut vowels are lower than foot vowels in the vowel space. We suggest that co-articulatory effects of surrounding consonants explain this instrumental difference, as they have significant lowering/heightening effects on the acoustics but are not fully captured by our statistical model. We argue that the perplexing nature of the historical split can be partially accounted for in this data, as the frequency of co-occurring phonetic environments is notably different in foot than in strut, resulting in cumulative effects of co-articulation. We also present evidence of age grading which suggests that middle class speakers may develop a phonetic distinction as they age.},

Half of the English words were produced by standard New Zealand English (Pākehā English) speakers and half by Māori English speakers. We find robust evidence for within-language repetition priming for both Māori-only and English-only trials. Across languages, there is L1–L2 priming: both Pākehā English and Māori English successfully prime Māori. The effect size, however, is larger for Māori English–Māori trials than Pākehā English–Māori trials. In the L2–L1 direction Māori only primes Māori English, not Pākehā English. These results support the hypothesis that indexical categories – e.g., ethnic identity – facilitate word recognition across languages, particularly in the L2–L1 direction, where translation priming has not always been obtained in the literature.

Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back up-gliding vowels /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features of local phonology, tense /aeh/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education. Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadel-phia vowel system can be understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in com-mon with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here as subject to phonological generaliza-tions but driven by social evaluation as features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community.*},

	abstract = {This paper examines the degree of sociolinguistic change in the English of young middle-class South Africans of different ethnic backgrounds in relation to new post-apartheid opportunities and friendships. Once tightly controlled, social networks of young people of middle-class background are now deracialising. The paper examines whether young people of the major ethnic groups, Black, Coloured and Indian, are simply adopting prestige White middle-class norms, adapting them or resisting change. Forty-eight speakers were analysed within a Labovian framework in relation to the goose vowel (long /u/or /uw/). Over 4000 tokens were analysed acoustically using PRAAT and compared via vowel normalisation procedures based on Watt and Fabricius (2003). The results show that middle-class speakers of the three ethnicities are fronting the vowel, but in different ways. Black speakers show the greatest accommodation to erstwhile White norms. Females show greater resistance among Coloureds and Indians, but overall it is the Black females of the study who approximate most closely to the norms of the White reference group of their gender.},

	abstract = {How flexible is an individual’s accent during adulthood, and how does this flexibility relate to longer-term change? Previous work has found that accents are remarkably flexible in conversational interaction, but predominantly stable over years, leading to very different views of the role of individuals in community-level sound change. This article examines medium-term accent dynamics (days to months) by taking advantage of a ‘natural experiment’: A reality television show where contestants live in an isolated house for three months and are constantly recorded, forming a closed system where it is possible to both determine the dynamics of contestants’ speech from day to day and reason about the sources of any observed changes. We build statistical models to examine time dependence in five phonetic variables within individuals, in 14.5 hours of spontaneous speech from twelve English-speaking contestants. We find that time dependence in pronunciation is ubiquitous over the medium term: large daily fluctuations in pronunciation are the norm, while longer-term change over weeks to months occurs in a minority of cases. These patterns mirror the conflicting findings of previous work and suggest a possible bridge between the two. We argue that time dependence in phonetic variables is influenced by contrast between sounds, as well as systematic differences between speakers in how malleable their accents are over time; however, we find only limited evidence for convergence in individuals’ accents. Our results have implications for theories of the role of individuals in sound change, and suggest that medium-term pronunciation dynamics are a fruitful direction for future work.},

Phonological rules also often display different rates of application across a given dialect continuum.

	volume = {24},
	url = {https://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol24/iss2/2},
	abstract = {This study presents a large-scale investigation of sociolinguistic variation in the phonetic realisation and phonemic status of FOOT and STRUT in Manchester English. As a Northern dialect of English, Manchester speakers typically lack the distinction between the FOOT and STRUT vowels, such that 'stud' and 'stood' are homophones. The data in the present study reveal that, despite the vast majority of speakers having no difference in production and perception, there is variation both in the phonemic status and the phonetic realisation of the two vowel classes within the speech community. The study is based on the acoustic analysis of a sample of 123 speakers stratified by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity, recorded in sociolinguistic interviews, supplemented with wordlist reading and minimal-pair tests. Our approach to the analysis considers the vowel classes both as one phoneme, and as the two split lexical sets. The acoustic measurements reveal that tokens in the STRUT category show a monotonic pattern of social class stratification, with higher social classes showing higher F1 values, i.e., having a lower tongue position. The minimal-pair tests of the FOOT-STRUT distinction reveal that although for most speakers there is no phonemic distinction, for 8 speakers in the two highest socioeconomic levels in the sample, the two vowels do form separate categories. This is confirmed by the acoustic measurements of their vowel tokens: there is clear phonetic separation between the two vocalic categories in phonetic space. Interestingly, even when these 8 speakers are removed from the sample, regression analysis shows that for the sample as a whole, vowel category (i.e., STRUT vs. FOOT) continues to have a significant effect, with STRUT tokens having a higher F1 mean (lower tongue position). This holds in cases where there is complete overlap between the two vowels in phonetic space. We explore the possibility that this may be due to the different phonological environment in which the two vowel classes tend to be found and that it may shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the historical split between the two vowel classes in the south of England.},

Among younger Philadelphians oriented to higher education, the traditional short-a system is giving way to the nasal system, in which all prenasal vowels are tense. We present evidence that this shift occurs systematically in both the lax and tense allophones. The degree of conformity to each system is measured for 106 subjects by the Pillai statistic; community-wide patterns are revealed by regression modeling and bimodality diagrams. Adherence to the traditional system is greatest for White speakers who graduated from Catholic high schools, while the nasal system is strongest for graduates from elite schools with special admission requirements. African American students show no orientation to the traditional system, but parallel White students in the shift to the nasal system. The histories of students through the educational system show that the speaker's short-a system is largely determined during their middle and high school years, before entering college. Special admission interviews play a special role in this process, as brief speech events that strongly determine the person's linguistic environment for the years that follow.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The present study employed a polyclonal antibody to characterize the distribution of trk-immunoreactive neurons within the nonhuman primate brain. Both young adult and aged cebus and rhesus monkeys displayed trk-immunoreactive neurons within all subdivisions of the basal forebrain. Colocalization studies revealed that between 66\% and 76\% of trk-immunoreactive basal forebrain neurons also expressed immunoreactivity for the low-affinity p75 NGF receptor, an excellent marker for cholinergic basal forebrain cells. In this experiment, most single-labeled basal forebrain neurons contained only trk immunoreactivity, whereas 4\% of basal forebrain neurons expressed only the low-affinity p75 NGF receptor. Scattered trk-immunoreactive neurons also were observed within the caudate nucleus and putamen. Although dual-localization studies with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were not performed, striatal neurons codistributed with ChAT-immunoreactive cells, and both types of cells were similar in size and morphology. This suggests that trk immunoreactivity is expressed within cholinergic interneurons within the primate striatum. Finally, lightly stained trk-immunoreactive neurons were observed within the stratum oriens of the hippocampal formation and within the hypothalamus. These data indicate that both cholinergic and, possibly, noncholinergic forebrain neurons express the protein for the high-affinity trk receptor, which transduces the signal mediating the trophic effects of neurotrophins. In addition, the pattern of trk immunoreactivity was preserved in two aged (26 and 29 years old) rhesus monkeys, suggesting that the expression of trk, for the most part, is sustained throughout the lifetime of the organism.},

The effects of phonological context and speaking style are also examined. Patterns in the data are suggestive of dialect leveling, whereby localized speech variants become recessive and pronunciations typical of a wider geographical area are adopted. Within this broad pattern, however, there is evidence of parallelism be- tween the vowels in terms of the relative proportions of their variants across speaker groups. It is suggested that pressure to maintain the symmetrical structure of the underlying phonological system is guiding this process. Labov’s (1991, 1994) prin- ciples of chain shift are discussed in this connection. However, it is argued that the patterns in the data are more plausibly explained by considering the social signifi- cance of each variant instead of making reference to variants as socially neutral expressions of abstract phonological categories.},

Once tightly controlled, social networks of young people of middle-class background are now deracialising. The paper examines whether young people of the major ethnic groups, Black, Coloured and Indian, are simply adopting prestige White middle-class norms, adapting them or resisting change. Forty-eight speakers were analysed within a Labovian framework in relation to the goose vowel (long /u/or /uw/). Over 4000 tokens were analysed acoustically using PRAAT and compared via vowel normalisation procedures based on Watt and Fabricius (2003). The results show that middle-class speakers of the three ethnicities are fronting the vowel, but in different ways. Black speakers show the greatest accommodation to erstwhile White norms. Females show greater resistance among Coloureds and Indians, but overall it is the Black females of the study who approximate most closely to the norms of the White reference group of their gender.},

This process is hypothesised to follow from the fragmentation of tight-knit urban communities that formed after large-scale immigration to Tyneside from elsewhere in the British Isles during the 18th and 19th centuries. High levels of dialect contact brought about by this influx are argued to have promoted the creation of an urban koiné, which in its contemporary form appears increasingly to be losing specifically local features. In addition to contact and mobility as agents of change, the history of unusually acute stigma attached to Tyneside speech should be considered. These and other social factors inform an analysis of the FACE and GOAT variables in the speech of 32 contemporary Tyneside English speakers of various ages, both sexes and from two social class groups.},

We present evidence that this shift occurs systematically in both the lax and tense allophones. The degree of conformity to each system is measured for 106 subjects by the Pillai statistic; community-wide patterns are revealed by regression modeling and bimodality diagrams. Adherence to the traditional system is greatest for White speakers who graduated from Catholic high schools, while the nasal system is strongest for graduates from elite schools with special admission requirements. African American students show no orientation to the traditional system, but parallel White students in the shift to the nasal system. The histories of students through the educational system show that the speaker's short-a system is largely determined during their middle and high school years, before entering college. Special admission interviews play a special role in this process, as brief speech events that strongly determine the person's linguistic environment for the years that follow.},

The speakers show remarkable first dialect stability with respect to their low back vowel system, even after many years of new dialect exposure: in minimal pair contexts, nearly all of the speakers continue to produce and perceive a single vowel category. However, in word list and conversational contexts, the majority of speakers exhibit a small but significant phonetic difference between words like cot and caught, reflecting the separation of these word classes in the new dialect to which they are exposed; moreover, the realization of these words shows frequency effects consistent with a lexically gradual divergence of the two vowels.

In this paper, we investigate the phonetic nature of this latter diachronic development: does it happen through small gradient increments, or is there a categorical shift from one allophone to another? We focus on GOOSE-fronting and /l/-darkening in Southern British English, the interaction of which is sensitive to morphological boundaries. Relatively retracted realisations of the vowel and dark realisations of the /l/ appear before a morpheme boundary, even when a vowel follows (e.g. fool-ing), whereas in monomorphemic words (e.g. hula), there is more /uː/-fronting, and the /l/ is relatively lighter. We analyse the phonetic realisation of such pairs as hula vs. fool-ing in 20 speakers of Southern British English using both acoustic and articulatory (ultrasound) instrumental methods. All the speakers express the morphological contrast in some way, although effect sizes vary dramatically. For some speakers, the contrast involves subtle articulatory differences without any clear acoustic consequences, whereas other speakers show robust differences employing multiple phonetic correlates. We therefore argue that the hula{\textasciitilde}fool-ing contrast would be misrepresented if analysed in terms of a small number of either /uː/ or /l/ allophonic categories. Instead, we interpret the results as supporting the predictions of phonological frameworks that incorporate phonetically-gradient morphologisation.},

Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back up-gliding vowels /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features of local phonology, tense /aeh/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education. Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadel-phia vowel system can be understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in com-mon with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here as subject to phonological generaliza-tions but driven by social evaluation as features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community.*},

Among younger Philadelphians oriented to higher education, the traditional short-a system is giving way to the nasal system, in which all prenasal vowels are tense. We present evidence that this shift occurs systematically in both the lax and tense allophones. The degree of conformity to each system is measured for 106 subjects by the Pillai statistic; community-wide patterns are revealed by regression modeling and bimodality diagrams. Adherence to the traditional system is greatest for White speakers who graduated from Catholic high schools, while the nasal system is strongest for graduates from elite schools with special admission requirements. African American students show no orientation to the traditional system, but parallel White students in the shift to the nasal system. The histories of students through the educational system show that the speaker's short-a system is largely determined during their middle and high school years, before entering college. Special admission interviews play a special role in this process, as brief speech events that strongly determine the person's linguistic environment for the years that follow.},

The characteristics of phonetics and phonology are then covered. The article describes a few specific examples of proposals of the nature of the interface. A quasimodular framework rejects the widespread assumption among phonologists that 'categorical' and 'gradient' are themselves distinct. Recent results motivating Exemplar approaches involve interaction between idiolectal phonetics and the phonetics of contrast: somehow the characteristics of individual speakers can be stored and processed along with phonological and lexical information.},

This paper presents an empirical study of this synchronic variation, specifically to test predictions made by the life cycle of phonological processes; a diachronic account of/Eí/-deletion has been proposed under this framework, but crucially the life cycle makes hitherto-untested predictions regarding the synchronic behaviour of (ng) in north-west England. Data from 30 sociolinguistic interviews indicate that these predictions are largely met: Internal constraints on the variable are almost entirely accounted for by assuming cyclic application of/Eí/-deletion across a stratified phonology. There is also evidence of apparent time change in the pre-pausal environment, which is becoming increasingly [Eí]-favouring contrary to the life cycle's predictions. It is argued that this reflects a separate innovation in the life cycle of (ng), with synchronic variation reflecting two processes: (i) the original deletion, overlaid with (ii) a prosodically-conditioned insertion process. These results have implications for theories of language change and the architecture of grammar and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the effect of pause on probabilistic phenomena can be synchronically variable and diachronically unstable.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	title = {Phonetic variation in intervocalic onset /l/s in \{{English}\}},
	volume = {25},
	issn = {0095-4470},
	abstract = {The English /l/ is often described as having a finite number of contextually
determined allophones: a backer, \#velarize\#\#d\#, allophone in syllable
rimes, a fronter allophone in syllable onsets, and a syllabic allophone,
a special variant of the back /l/, in stressless syllables. In contrast,
Sproat \& Fujimura (1993) argued that variation in /l/ quality is
a more continuous phenomenon, governed by principles of phonetic
implementation determining the timing and extent of an apical gesture
and a dorsal gesture for /l/. They claimed that the /l/'s dorsum-backing
gesture is attracted to the syllable nucleus. Therefore in rimes,
dorsum backing begins well before the apical gesture, and the longer
the rime, the more extensive the backing. In onsets, on the other
hand, the dorsum gesture is either simultaneous with, or follows,
the apical gesture, which means that /l/ is short, and there is little
time for backing. The study reported here investigates the relation
between timing and quality in intervocalic onset /l/'s following
schwa, a segmental context expected to produce considerable temporal
variation across tokens, but which, according to Sproat and Fujimura's
model, should not show much variation in degree of backness. Acoustic
data from eight female speakers reading in a fluid narrative style
shows that onset /l/'s do vary in backness, and suggests that backness
is related to gestural timing. Backer onset /l/'s are usually longer,
which means that Sproat and Fujimura's notions of gestural affinity
and gestural separation require modification. The tongue dorsum gesture
for /l/ appears to avoid temporal overlap with a stressed vowel,
whether or not that vowel is in the same syllable. The data also
show, however, that longer /l/'s are not always backer: the relation
of duration and backness can be complicated by differences in coarticulatory
effects of neighboring vowels, or by speaker-specific constraints
on absolute degree of backness. All of these contributing factors
can be accommodated within a model of phonetic implementation sensitive
to prosodic structure.},

account of present-day accents of English, calls `hyper-rhoticity'.
That is, the appearance, in rhotic accents, of epenthetic, unetymological
rhyme-/r/, usually taking the form of /r/-colouring in modern accents.
It is attested most commonly in final unstressed syllables, but may
also occur in syllable rhymes after a long, stressed vowel. The article
traces the history of this phenomenon and attempts to show that Early
Modern English data which have hitherto been interpreted as evidence
for loss of /r/ in such contexts are better attributed to hyperrhoticity.
It is also argued here, in an addendum, that not to accept claims
for early /r/-loss in unstressed syllables has wider implications
for the history of English phonology. That is, to reject theories
of loss of /r/ in final unstressed syllables demands rejection of
the notion of early articulatory weakening of /r/ in this context,
which has been seen as a prelude to the spread of weakening to other
contexts, leading ultimately to loss of rhoticity.},

by the first author, we explore how the process of TH-Fronting is
complicated in this community by the existence of certain local variants
which are lexically restricted, and we question to what extent the
frequency patterns that are apparent in these data are consistent
with generalisations made in the wider literature on the relationship
between lexical frequency and phonological change.},

Often researchers interested in frequency effects take the frequency value of a particular lexical item from a large corpus such as the Brown Corpus (e.g. Dinkin 2008 and Abramowicz 2006) or from a list of frequency counts such as that provided by Baayen et al. (1995) in the form of the CELEX lexical database (employed by Hay 2001)." They find that frequency has an effect, but argue it can't be considered alone: p.52 "We propose that it is vital not only to consider the role of lexical frequency as an explanatory factor in the spread of sound change but to embed this further within a wider theoretical framework of language use."},

	abstract = {© 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston. There are synchronic sources of data that can provide an additional line of evidence which may be useful in reconstructing sound changes: patterns of sound change in progress and experimentally induced changes, variation in production, natural errors in production and perception, experimentally elicited errors in perception and production, and experiments and simulations of iterated learning. This article surveys existing studies that have made use of such evidence in support of sound changes and reviews limitations of experimental methods and factors to consider when designing experiments to use these parallels to inform sound change. To demonstrate the parallels between patterns in synchronic data and sound changes, a sample typology of diachronic developments was compared with patterns of categorical errors from experimentally elicited misperception in adverse listening conditions and errors of perception and production in natural speech. All of these correlations are highly significant, demonstrating the potential of such synchronic data as a source of parallels to provide evidence for reconstructed sound changes.},

While Wells (1982) dates this change after 1750, Lass (2000) and McMahon (2000)
argue that the decline of coda-r started much earlier, perhaps in Early Modern English,
with the weakening of preconsonantal and prepausal r, and was already `under way,
producing variants in the speech community, before 1700' (McMahon 2000: 234).
For a detailed overview of the orthoepic evidence the reader is referred to McMahon
(2000: 237--41). It is important to note that the historical sources do not point to
a complete disappearance of coda-r in SBE: there is a marked lack of agreement
among eighteenth-century authors as to whether coda-r is pronounced or not, which
suggests that r Dropping was variable at this stage.},

EDA is a free iOS and Android app, launched in January 2016 that features a dialect quiz and dialect recordings. For the quiz, users indicate which variants of 26 words they use and the application guesses their local dialect; for the recordings, users can record a short text. The result is EDAC which includes metadata on mobility, ethnicity, age, educational level, and gender. More than 47,000 users from across the UK have indicated dialect variants for these 26 words, and more than 3,500 users have provided audio recordings. Unavoidably, EDAC does not successfully reflect distributions of age, ethnicity, qualification levels, and other parameters found for the UK population given that smartphone-based research reaches a specific stratum of the population. Yet there are also clear benefits to the sampling strategy used – benefits and pitfalls are discussed in this article. Future analyses will provide the most comprehensive understanding of English regional dialect variation since the work of the traditional dialectologists. We showcase two such analyses in this article. EDAC should, we demonstrate, be of interest to researchers in dialectology but also in forensic phonetics.},

	abstract = {Most linguistic theories assume lexicon entries which incorporate the idea of the Saussurean sign, a bidirectional mapping between a phonological form and some representation of a concept. This Sign, like grammars generally, is unbiased with respect to perception or production, and provides part of the cognitive map which speakers use both in speaking and in interpreting the utterances of others. This bidirectionality of the Sign, or code, is a design feature of human language although workable communication does not necessarily incorporate such a feature. Part of the Language Acquisition Device is a mechanism which mentally constructs such a biderectional mapping, on the basis of observed samples of communicative behaviour (transmission and reception). This basic aspect of the LAD presumably evolved because of its superiority over other conceivable mechanisms for acquiring a basis for communicative behaviour from a sampling of observed transmission and reception data. Three conceivable strategies for acquiring the basis of communicative behaviour, here labelled the Imitator, Calculator, and Saussurean strategies, are defined as functions from samplings of observed behaviour to acquired behaviour patterns. Essentially, the Imitator imitates the transmission and reception patterns in the observed sample; the Calculator constructs optimal reception responses to the transmissions in the observed sample and optimal transmission responses to receptions in the observed sample; the Saussurean imitates the transmission behaviour in the sample, but shapes his reception behaviour to mirror the acquired transmission behaviour, thus internalizing the equivalent of a set of bidirectional Saussurean signs. Extensive simulations of populations endowed with these innate strategies show the Saussurean strategy to be a winner in evolutionary terms; it produces individuals who communicate more successfully than individuals endowed with the other two strategies. ?? 1989.},

Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back up-gliding vowels /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features of local phonology, tense /aeh/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education. Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadel-phia vowel system can be understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in com-mon with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here as subject to phonological generaliza-tions but driven by social evaluation as features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community.*},

	abstract = {A perceptual learning experiment provides evidence that the mental
lexicon cannot consist solely of detailed acoustic traces of recognition
episodes. In a training lexical decision phase, listeners heard an
ambiguous [fâ€``s] fricative sound, replacing either [f] or [s]
in words. In a test phase, listeners then made lexical decisions
to visual targets following auditory primes. Critical materials were
minimal pairs that could be a word with either [f] or [s] (cf. English
knifeâ€``nice), none of which had been heard in training. Listeners
interpreted the minimal pair words differently in the second phase
according to the training received in the first phase. Therefore,
lexically mediated retuning of phoneme perception not only influences
categorical decisions about fricatives (Norris, McQueen, \&amp; Cutler,
2003), but also benefits recognition of words outside the training
set. The observed generalization across words suggests that this
retuning occurs prelexically. Therefore, lexical processing involves
sublexical phonological abstraction, not only accumulation of acoustic
episodes.},

examine the rate of possible dialect-levelling based on the data analysis from a famous British
reality show The Geordie Shore. The first part of the thesis consists of the necessary
theoretical survey of the history, origins, social background and historical dialect continuum
of Geordie that all influenced the Geordie dialect and its development and evolution
throughout the years. The second part of the thesis contains empirical qualitative research of
the Geordie features based on the speech of the five young adults featured in the reality show
under consideration. This analysis will provide information about possible dialect-levelling on
one hand and dialect retention on the other hand. Comparing the traditional dialect description
and the most common linguistic features of the speech of the younger generations of speakers
in their authentic and genuine conversations will serve as guidelines in establishing whether
the dialect has changed significantly over the years.},

	abstract = {The pronunciation of the bath vowel is a salient feature of English varieties of the southwest of England, yet neither the status of the trap–bath split in traditional dialects nor ongoing change today is well understood. After reviewing the existing literature, we investigate the quality and length of low unrounded vowels in Bristol English on the basis of sociolinguistic interviews with twenty-five speakers. The picture suggested by these data is complex: there is evidence for a traditional length-only trap–bath split, for a length and backness split diffusing from the east and for a merger diffusing from the north. Some of these changes involve lexical diffusion, especially with loanwords and other distinctive lexical groups. Overall, the rich and contradictory data speak to the contested sociolinguistic status of these variables and to the need to examine individual patterns of variation closely to gain a full understanding of them.},

	doi = {10.1515/lingvan-2019-0058},
	abstract = {Forced aligners have revolutionized sociophonetics, but while there are several forced aligners available, there are few systematic comparisons of their performance. Here, we consider four major forced aligners used in sociophonetics today: MAUS, FAVE, LaBB-CAT and MFA. Through comparisons with human coders, we find that both aligner and phonological context affect the quality of automated alignments of vowels extracted from English sociolinguistic interview data. MFA and LaBB-CAT produce the highest quality alignments, in some cases not significantly different from human alignment, followed by FAVE, and then MAUS. Aligners are less accurate placing boundaries following a vowel than preceding it, and they vary in accuracy across manner of articulation, particularly for following boundaries. These observations allow us to make specific recommendations for manual correction of forced alignment.},
