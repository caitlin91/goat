abstract = {The autocorrelation function, a measure of regularity in the speech signal, is applied in demarcating the seemingly diffuse intervals of glottalization which accompany or replace voiceless oral stops in elicited recordings from 22 young speakers of Southern British English. It is shown that a local minimum in autocorrelation characterizes almost all instances heard as intervocalic glottal stops; an annotation procedure is developed and used to gather data on glottalization gestures, including duration, f0, energy and autocorrelation. The same measure is used to assess regularity of vocal fold vibration in an interval just prior to the formation of the total closure for instances of syllable-final /t/, and confirms significantly lower autocorrelation in a group auditorily judged 'pre-glottalized'. Implications are considered both for normal speech perception and for expert phonetic judgments.},

abstract = {This study examines the internal and external constraints on glottal replacement of /t/ among adolescents in London and Edinburgh. Results show that phonological and stylistic constraints play an important role in determining the realizational variation of /t/, as many similar studies have shown. However, there is also clear evidence that our understanding of this phenomenon has been restricted by the limited set of factors that have been investigated previously, as results show that this feature is also constrained by word frequency and morphophonological factors. These findings raise important questions concerning the role of morphological compositionality in language change and the nature of lexical diffusion.},

@article{Garellek2016,
abstract = {In American English, the presence of creaky voice can derive from distinct linguistic processes, including phrasal creak (pro- longed irregular voicing, often at edges of prosodic phrases) and coda /t/ glottalization (when the alveolar closure for syllable- final /t/ is replaced by or produced simultaneously with glottal constriction). Previous work has shown that listeners can differ- entiate words in phrasal creak from those with /t/ glottalization, which suggests that there are acoustic differences between the creaky voice derived from phrasal creak and /t/ glottalization. In this study, we analyzed vowels preceding syllable-final /t/ in the Buckeye Corpus, which includes audio recordings of spon- taneous speech from 40 speakers of American English. Tokens were coded for presence of phrasal creak (prolonged irregular voicing extending beyond the target syllable) and /t/ glottaliza- tion (whether the /t/ was produced only with glottal constric- tion). Eleven spectral measures of voice quality, including both harmonic and noise measures, were extracted automatically and discriminant analyses were performed. The results indicate that the discriminant functions can classify these sources of creaky voice above chance, and that Cepstral Peak Prominence, a mea- sure of harmonics-to-noise ratio, is important for distinguishing phrasal creak from glottalization.},

@article{Hillenbrand1996,
abstract = {Glottal stops that occur in vowel-consonant-vowel context are often not realized as stops at all, but rather show voicing that is continuous throughout the glottal constriction gesture. Glottal articulations that are realized in this way are apparently marked by reductions in amplitude and fundamental frequency. In the present study measurements from naturally produced utterances containing the sequence /o?o/ (i.e., a glottal stop separating two identical vowels) were used to create a set of synthetic stimuli that varied in their F0 and amplitude contours. The utterances were resynthesized in six ways: (a) original pitch/original amplitude, (b) original pitch/flat amplitude, (c) flat pitch/original amplitude, (d) flat pitch/flat amplitude, (e) flat pitch/inverted amplitude, and (f) inverted pitch/flat amplitude. Results indicated that: (a) a dip in the pitch contour is nearly always sufficient to cue the presence of a glottal stop in the absence of any drop in amplitude, (b) a dip in the amplitude contour is usually sufficient to cue the presence of a glottal stop, and (c) signals with inverted contours were not heard as glottal stops, indicating that it is not merely an abrupt change that is needed to signal a glottal stop.},

We examined patterns of phonological variation and change in contemporary urban dialects using quantitative sociolinguistic methods, instrumental phonetic and phonological analysis. Conversational and word-list data were systematically collected from 32 Tyneside and 32 Derby speakers, each sample being stratified to include equal numbers of men and women, two age-groups and two social class groups. This sample design allowed us to assess the impact of age, class, and gender on patterns of language variation and change, as well as the geographical domains of specific changes. The principal results are described and their theoretical implications are discussed.},
