abstract = {This paper presents the results of an acoustic analysis of /s/ as produced by a socially-stratified sample of 31 speakers of Glaswegian. Single spectral and whole spectrum measures together confirm a consistent effect of sex, whilst interactions of age and class in the same measures suggest that acoustic patterns indexical of gender are also present.},

@article{Stevens2016,
abstract = {In contemporary spoken English, /s/ can resemble a post-alveolar fricative when it occurs in /str/ clusters e.g. street. /s/-retraction in /str/ is known to be widespread in North American English, but the question of how this sound change comes about has attracted only a very small amount of empirical research. This paper investigates the phonetic pre-conditions for /s/-retraction based on the results of two experiments conducted with Australian English. Study 1 shows that the first spectral moment (M1) for /s/ is lower in /spr, str, skr/ and slightly lower in /sp, st, sk/ than in pre-vocalic position. Temporal variation in first spectral moment trajectories suggests that the articulatory movements associated with the rhotic are timed relatively earlier in /str/ vs. /spr, skr/ clusters. Study 2 tested native listener categorization of sibilants produced by multiple talkers. Results show that sibilants originally produced in stream and steam elicit /ʃ/ responses when spliced into pre-vocalic contexts. There was an interaction with talker gender, with male voices eliciting more /ʃ/ responses. Thus, the conditions for sound change to occur by which /s/ becomes /ʃ/ originate in a synchronic bias for /s/ produced in /sC(r)/ clusters to show increased auditory similarity to /ʃ/. Australian English shows the pre-conditions for /s/-retraction but is not currently undergoing this sound change.},
annote = {Themes:
1. Starts gradul and becomes categoriacal
2. Biological sex on pronunciation + social aspects of gender
3. Methodology of measuring /s/


Very systematic on looking for precursors. Tested, not just suggestions.

Categorical gradient question.
Sex/Gender diffrence between s/sh length. 
Normalisation techniwues remove sex differences to show gender differences (s - dental articulation for female)
