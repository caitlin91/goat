abstract = {This study is a formant-based investigation of the vowels of male$\backslash$nspeakers in 13 accents of the British Isles. It provides F1/F2 graphs$\backslash$n(obtained with a semi-automatic method) which could be used as starting$\backslash$npoints for more thorough analyses. The article focuses on both phonetic$\backslash$nrealization and systemic phenomena, and it also provides detailed$\backslash$ninformation on automatic formant measurements. The aim is to obtain$\backslash$nan up-to-date picture of withinand between-accent vowel variation$\backslash$nin the British Isles. F1/F2 graphs plot z-scored Barktransformed$\backslash$nformant frequencies, and values in Hertz are also provided. Along$\backslash$nwith the findings, a number of methodological issues are addressed.},
