abstract = {This article reviews and exemplifies the theory of the life cycle of phonological processes and illustrates how diachronic phonological changes can be accounted for in a stratal/cyclic model of phonology. The life cycle captures the fact that sound change operates in orderly stages and that phonological processes become increasing integrated with morphosyntactic structure as they age. Phonological rules also often display different rates of application across a given dialect continuum. Thus, the developmental phases that a phonological innovation goes through in its life cycle define a template of language change; and these stages of change reflect synchronic patterns of microtypological variation.},

@phdthesis{Iscrulescu2006,
abstract = {This dissertation explores the correlation between grammatical markedness
and the phonological properties of outputs inflected for morpho-syntactic
categories on a grammatical markedness hierarchy. The main claim
made in the thesis is that, under otherwise similar phonological
conditions, outputs carrying specifications for a marked member (g)
of a given grammatical category (G) can license a given type of marked
phonological structure (M) to an extent that is equal or greater
than outputs inflected for the unmarked category. I label this generalization
'Marked in the Marked' (MIM). Within the theoretical framework assumed
for the dissertation (Optimality Theory, Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004),
I propose that the universal repository of constraints (CON) be enriched
so as to include a family of formal licensing constraints LICENSE(M,g)
that license marked phonological structure (M) in output words that
carry the morpho-syntactic specifications of the marked member (g)
of G. I propose that the licensing constraint is functionally grounded
in the sense that the marked value g is determined by recourse to
language use factors such as frequency of occurrence in discourse.
Only licensing constraints for marked values g are allowed in CON.
The content of the notions 'grammatical markedness' and 'phonological
markedness' is reviewed and criteria for the two kinds of markedness
are discussed. Manifestations of phonological markedness and their
grammatical category underpinnings are discussed at the following
levels: prosodic (Old Saxon), segmental (Romanian) and phonotactic
(Mayak). For all these cases, the Marked in the Marked constraint
schema (in interaction with other relevant constraints) and the factorial
typology associated with it are shown to make the correct empirical
predictions. A functional grounding account of the MIM effects discussed
in the dissertation is laid out. MIM phenomena are assumed to arise
from factors of economy in language production in the sense that
confining marked phonological structure to less frequent, grammatically
marked forms contributes to minimization of speaker's effort. Also,
the presence of marked phonological material in outputs inflected
for the marked grammatical category may have certain advantages in
language perception, retrieval and acquisition. },

abstract = {The study of sound change in progress in Philadelphia has been facilitated by the application of forced alignment and automatic vowel measurement to a large corpus of neighborhood studies, in-cluding 379 speakers with dates of birth from 1888 to 1991. Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back up-gliding vowels /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features of local phonology, tense /aeh/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education. Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadel-phia vowel system can be understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in com-mon with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here as subject to phonological generaliza-tions but driven by social evaluation as features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community.*},

place assimilation of coronal stops followed by labial or velar stops,
both within words and across words. The results show that this place-assimilation
process is highly variable, both within and across speakers, and
is also sensitive to factors such as the place of articulation of
the following consonant, the presence of a word boundary and, to
some extent, speech rate. Gestures affected by the process are generally
reduced categorically (deleted), while sporadic gradient reduction
of gestures is also observed. We further compare the results for
coronals to our previous findings on the assimilation of labials,
discussing implications of the results for grammatical models of
phonological/phonetic competence. The results suggest that speakers'
language-particular knowledge of place assimilation has to be relatively
detailed and context-sensitive, and has to encode systematic regularities
about its obligatory/variable application as well as categorical/gradient
realisation.},

abstract = {The vocalization of /l/ results from the loss of contact between the
tongue and the palate in the articulation of the liquid, which produces
a glide that is acoustically similar to {\{}u{\}}. This phenomenon is documented
in a number of languages in word-final and syllable-final position,
and it has also been reported in a few dialects of American English.
The case of /l/-vocalization in Philadelphia is unusual in that the
vocalized variant occurs variably in every position in the word where
/l/ can occur. This includes not only word- and syllable-final position,
but also intervocalic, as in "really," syllable-initial clusters,
as in "play," and word- and syllable-initial, as in "like" and "quickly."
This study attempts to clarify the linguistic and social factors
which condition /l/-vocalization in Philadelphia and to determine
whether the variation is showing evidence of change in progress.

The data were collected from tape-recorded interviews of 54 native
Philadelphia men and women representing a range of ethnic and socioeconomic
groups, ages, and neighborhoods in the city. (Blacks were not included
in the study.) A total of more than 23,000 occurrences of the variable
were collected. Most of these were coded for seven linguistic factors,
speaking style, and five social factors. Multivariable analysis (VARBRUL2)
was used to analyze the data. Initially the occurrences of (l) in
each position in the word were analyzed separately, and later the
tokens in certain pairs of environments were merged and reanalyzed
to determine whether they behaved the same or differently.

The bulk of the analysis was performed on postvocalic final and intervocalic
/l/ since /l/-vocalization is most frequent in these positions: in
the present sample, it occurs in both environments 19{\%} of the time.

The linguistic conditioning of the variation for the most part follows
straightforwardly from the predicted effects of articulatory factors.
Some exceptions are examined in detail.

The social distribution shows a pattern of interaction indicating
that /l/-vocalization in Philadelphia is receding. Although the overt
stigmatization attached to vocalized /l/ is minimal, it appears that
the upper working/lower middle class is leading a movement away from
the use of vocalized /l/ in final and intervocalic positions.

A survey of the use of vocalized /l/ was also carried out using data
from tape-recorded interviews from communities all over the United
States. The results of this study suggest that /l/-vocalization was
an innovation of the Midland dialect region, with Philadelphia as
the most likely point of origin. It has spread west through and beyond
this area, as far as California; it has moved up the East Coast at
a low level of frequency; and it has made some inroads into the northern
cities, including Rochester, Cleveland, and Detroit, though there
was no evidence of it in Chicago. The least amount of vocalized /l/
was found in the South.},

@phdthesis{Chung2007,
abstract = {This dissertation studies the component of PF, i.e., morphology, phonology
and phonetics, in Korean in a consistently derivational approach.
Using phonological arguments and an acoustic phonetic study, chapter
2 identifies the surface syllable structure. It also recognizes the
two syllable structure constraints: the complex onset constraint
and the branching nucleus constraint. Using this syllable structure
and these constraints, chapter 3 provides a comprehensive analysis
of hiatus in verbal morphology and related issues within Calabrese's
(1995, 2002a) Dynamic Phonology framework. A limited number of actual
outcomes for similar hiatus configurations show that the constraint-induced
repairs are not finite but limited, and subject to the general principle
of economy. It is shown that economy chooses shorter derivations
over longer ones, when more than one derivation is possible and yield
the same final outcome. It also shows that the hiatus constraint
is a non-surface, cyclic constraint, operating once per morpho¬phonological
cycle. Furthermore, it argues that certain phonological operations
must be described with the traditional rule-like formalism. It is
also pointed out that the syllable structure constraints identified
in chapter 2 are surface constraints. Chapters 4 and 5 provide a
morphological study in Distributed Morphology (Bobaljik 2000, Halle
and Marantz 1993, Marantz 2006). With verbal and adjectival roots
exhibiting negative and honorific suppletion, these chapters identify
the morphological structure of the inflected predicates (and hence
phrase structure to a certain extent) in Korean. It identifies the
paradoxical situation arising from the interaction of negative suppletion
and honorific suppletion: the structurally outer honorific morphology
blocks the inner negative suppletion. Root allomorphy of honorific
suppletion is analyzed as vocabulary insertion, and the portmanteau
negative suppletion is characterized as fusion interleaved with vocabulary
insertion. The notion of phases (Chomsky 2000, et seq.) explains
the unavailability of honorific suppletion with causatives. The dissertation
resolves the issue of opacity, the major problem of a representational
and parallelist theory The derivational approach allows a coherent
and more adequate grammatical analysis of Korean morpho-phonology.
It highlights the ecological nature of language, in that language
is a living, dynamic and organic body, and more than simply a static
or representational object.},

abstract = {This article reviews Lexical Phonology, a theory of rules and derivations. Rules are of three types: cyclic rules, postcyclic rules, and postlexical rules. Various diag-nostic properties of rules are discussed, including the phonological cycle, word vs. phrase domain application, the Strict Cyclicity Constraint, derived environments, the Structure Preservation Constraint, lexical conditioning, and the interaction of phonology and morphology. The data are drawn from English, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Slovak. Lexical Phonology grew out of The Sound Pattern of English (SPE hereafter; Chomsky and Halle 1968) as a refinement of the structure of the phono-logical and the morphological components of the grammar. The roots of Lexical Phonology go back to Kiparsky (1973), Mascar{\'{o}} (1976), Halle (1978), and Rubach (1981). The opening paper for the theory was Kiparsky's (1982) 'From Cyclic to Lexical Phonology'. The lexical framework inspired the research of the 1980s and 1990s, as I explain in Section 6. Today, Lexical Phonology remains the source of insight especially in two lines of pho-nological investigation: Distributed Morphology (DM) and Derivational Optimality Theory (DOT). It is for this reason that the theory merits attention in spite of the fact that it is no longer practised in the form as described in this article. Lexical Phonology is a theory of rules and derivations. It is a theory of rules, because it claims that rules are universally of three types: cyclic rules, postcyclic rules, and postlexical rules. It is a theory of derivations, because it claims that the way in which the derivation is organized is crucial to phonological analysis. In particular, some derivations proceed in steps, called cycles, while others do not. Non-cyclic derivations are of two types: word level derivations and postsyntactic derivations. Lexical Phonology is an extreme embodiment of Chomsky's (1970) lexicalist hypothesis. It is extreme because it claims that all word formation, including inflection, takes place in the lexicon. Furthermore, word formation rules (WFR hereafter) interact with a subset of phonological rules called cyclic rules. This interaction is possible, because cyclic},

abstract = {This article reviews and exemplifies the theory of the life cycle of phonological processes and illustrates how diachronic phonological changes can be accounted for in a stratal/cyclic model of phonology. The life cycle captures the fact that sound change operates in orderly stages and that phonological processes become increasing integrated with morphosyntactic structure as they age. Phonological rules also often display different rates of application across a given dialect continuum. Thus, the developmental phases that a phonological innovation goes through in its life cycle define a template of language change; and these stages of change reflect synchronic patterns of microtypological variation.},

@article{Dickson2017,
abstract = { Despite the prominence of socioeconomic status as a factor in models of English variation, few studies have explicitly considered speakers whose social class status changed over their lifetime. This paper presents an auditory and acoustic analysis of variation in non-prevocalic /r/ among middle-aged adults from Edinburgh, Scotland. The speakers represent three groups: the Established Middle Class (EMC) and the Working Class (WC), both of which are characterized as socioeconomically non-mobile, and a third group we call the New Middle Class (NMC), comprising individuals born to working-class families and living middle-class lives at the time of data collection. The results demonstrate that realizations of /r/ have a significant correlation with socioeconomic status, and that the effect of class further interacts with gender. NMC speakers demonstrate the highest level of rhoticity of all three groups. In contrast, WC men show extensive derhoticization and deletion, while WC women show patterns of rhoticity that are more comparable to the NMC women. The EMC speakers show more non-rhoticity than either the NMC speakers or the WC women. A consideration of the indexical value of weak rhoticity highlights the need for more robust phonetic measures distinguishing non-rhoticity from derhoticization, and to that end we consider the cue of post-vocalic frication. Overall, the results point to the need to conceptualize socioeconomic status as potentially fluid and changeable across the lifespan, thereby improving models of the relationship between social class and linguistic variation. },
