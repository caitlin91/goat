abstract = {Psychologists are navigating an unprecedented period of introspection about the credibility and utility of their discipline. Reform initiatives emphasize the benefits of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices; however, adoption across the psychology literature is unknown. Estimating the prevalence of such practices will help to gauge the collective impact of reform initiatives, track progress over time, and calibrate future efforts. To this end, we manually examined a random sample of 250 psychology articles published between 2014 and 2017. Over half of the articles were publicly available (154/237, 65{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = [59{\%}, 71{\%}]); however, sharing of research materials (26/183; 14{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [10{\%}, 19{\%}]), study protocols (0/188; 0{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [0{\%}, 1{\%}]), raw data (4/188; 2{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [1{\%}, 4{\%}]), and analysis scripts (1/188; 1{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [0{\%}, 1{\%}]) was rare. Preregistration was also uncommon (5/188; 3{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [1{\%}, 5{\%}]). Many articles included a funding disclosure statement (142/228; 62{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [56{\%}, 69{\%}]), but conflict-of-interest statements were less common (88/228; 39{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [32{\%}, 45{\%}]). Replication studies were rare (10/188; 5{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [3{\%}, 8{\%}]), and few studies were included in systematic reviews (21/183; 11{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [8{\%}, 16{\%}]) or meta-analyses (12/183; 7{\%}, 95{\%} CI = [4{\%}, 10{\%}]). Overall, the results suggest that transparency and reproducibility-related research practices were far from routine. These findings establish baseline prevalence estimates against which future progress toward increasing the credibility and utility of psychology research can be compared.},

preprint vs preregistration?

- do we have any previous estimates on these numbers in Linguistics?
I'm not sure many LVC linguists even understand what reproducibility would look like...},

abstract = {Serious concerns about research quality have catalysed a number of reform initiatives intended to improve transparency and reproducibility and thus facilitate self-correction, increase efficiency and enhance research credibility. Meta-research has evaluated the merits of some individual initiatives; however, this may not capture broader trends reflecting the cumulative contribution of these efforts. In this study, we manually examined a random sample of 250 articles in order to estimate the prevalence of a range of transparency and reproducibility-related indicators in the social sciences literature published between 2014 and 2017. Few articles indicated availability of materials (16/151, 11{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval, 7{\%} to 16{\%}]), protocols (0/156, 0{\%} [0{\%} to 1{\%}]), raw data (11/156, 7{\%} [2{\%} to 13{\%}]) or analysis scripts (2/156, 1{\%} [0{\%} to 3{\%}]), and no studies were pre-registered (0/156, 0{\%} [0{\%} to 1{\%}]). Some articles explicitly disclosed funding sources (or lack of; 74/236, 31{\%} [25{\%} to 37{\%}]) and some declared no conflicts of interest (36/236, 15{\%} [11{\%} to 20{\%}]). Replication studies were rare (2/156, 1{\%} [0{\%} to 3{\%}]). Few studies were included in evidence synthesis via systematic review (17/151, 11{\%} [7{\%} to 16{\%}]) or meta-analysis (2/151, 1{\%} [0{\%} to 3{\%}]). Less than half the articles were publicly available (101/250, 40{\%} [34{\%} to 47{\%}]). Minimal adoption of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices could be undermining the credibility and efficiency of social science research. The present study establishes a baseline that can be revisited in the future to assess progress.},
