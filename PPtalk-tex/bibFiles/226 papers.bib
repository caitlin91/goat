abstract = {While some sound changes occur in environments defined in purely phonological terms, others may become sensitive to morphological boundaries. In this paper, we investigate the phonetic nature of this latter diachronic development: does it happen through small gradient increments, or is there a categorical shift from one allophone to another? We focus on GOOSE-fronting and /l/-darkening in Southern British English, the interaction of which is sensitive to morphological boundaries. Relatively retracted realisations of the vowel and dark realisations of the /l/ appear before a morpheme boundary, even when a vowel follows (e.g. fool-ing), whereas in monomorphemic words (e.g. hula), there is more /uː/-fronting, and the /l/ is relatively lighter. We analyse the phonetic realisation of such pairs as hula vs. fool-ing in 20 speakers of Southern British English using both acoustic and articulatory (ultrasound) instrumental methods. All the speakers express the morphological contrast in some way, although effect sizes vary dramatically. For some speakers, the contrast involves subtle articulatory differences without any clear acoustic consequences, whereas other speakers show robust differences employing multiple phonetic correlates. We therefore argue that the hula{\~{}}fool-ing contrast would be misrepresented if analysed in terms of a small number of either /uː/ or /l/ allophonic categories. Instead, we interpret the results as supporting the predictions of phonological frameworks that incorporate phonetically-gradient morphologisation.},

Prince (see LLBA 12/I, 7800555), it is argued that the assignment of metrical structure is cyclic {\&} that there can be no deforestation. The proposed cyclicity changes permit Liberman's {\&} Prince's stress rules to cover certain regularities of English stress which were originally unaccounted for or handled in terms of the "metrical grid." Assuming that subsyllabic metrical structure is also assigned in cyclic fashion, {\&} recognizing the foot as a domain of segmental processes eliminates the necessity for ambisyllabicity in English phonology. 38 Figures. A. Sbragia},
