abstract = {1. Introduction It almost goes without saying that acceptability judgments form a continuous spectrum. While many sentences are either clearly acceptable or clearly unaccept-able, a significant number of sentences fall somewhere in between in a gray area of partial acceptability. This fact has been explicitly admitted by linguists since at least Chomsky 1965. The working assumption adopted by most linguists over the past 40 years has been that these intermediate levels of acceptability are caused by properties other than grammatical knowledge. Linguists have assumed that grammatical knowledge is categorical — sentences are either grammatical or ungrammatical — and that the continuous spectrum of acceptability is caused by extra-grammatical factors (plausibility, working memory limitations, etc.). Of course, ideas such as strength of violation have been introduced into theories of grammatical knowledge at various times, for instance Huang's (1982) proposal that ECP violations are stronger than Subjacency violations or Chomsky's (1986) proposal that each barrier crossed leads to lower acceptability. However, with the notable exception of Optimality Theory (see especially Keller 2000, 2003), these analyses have been the exception rather than the rule. The past ten years or so have seen a major shift in attitudes toward intermediate levels of acceptability. With the increasing use of formal experimental methods for measuring acceptability — a methodology that has come to be known as experimental syntax — it has become almost trivial to detect subtle differences along a continuous spectrum of acceptability. This new power afforded by experimental syntax raises the question of whether the continuity of acceptability reflects a continuity in grammatical knowledge that should be captured by the theory of grammar, or in other words, whether the working assumption of the past 40 years should be abandoned (see especially Keller 2000, Fanselow et al. 2004). While the answer to this question is ultimately an empirical one that is far from being settled, this report presents two pieces of experimental evidence for a categorical distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. The first is a direct prediction of theories that assume categorical grammaticality. The psychological claim underlying theories of categorical grammaticality is that ungrammatical sentences have no licit representation, or in other words, cannot be constructed from the available mental computations. Grammatical sentences, Biolinguistics  Reports  119 on the other hand, have licit representations that can be constructed from the available mental computations. This predicts that extra-grammatical factors that affect the acceptability and are predicated on the existence of a representation, such as syntactic priming (Luka {\&} Barsalou 2005), should not affect the accepta-bility of ungrammatical sentences. Section 2 presents results from Sprouse (2007) that confirm this prediction: Ungrammatical sentences, in particular island violations (Ross 1967), do not show a structural priming effect. The second piece of evidence comes from the experimental syntax technique magnitude estimation. Unlike traditional tasks such as the yes/no–task and the Likert scale task in which subjects must categorize their responses, magnitude estimation allows subjects to respond using the theoretically infinite continuum of values available on the positive number line (see Bard et al. 1996). By removing the categorization aspect of the task, one might expect that res-ponses would no longer show any categorical distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Contrary to this prediction, section 3 presents evidence from Sprouse (2007) that subjects impose a form of categorization on magnitude estimation responses, and that this categorization appears to correspond with the grammatical/ungrammatical distinction. 2.

@article{Lawson2013,
abstract = {For a century, phoneticians have noted a vowel merger in middle-class Scottish English, in the neutralisation of prerhotic checked vowels /I{\{}small{\}}/, /v{\{}inverted{\}}/, /e{\{}open{\}}/ to a central vowel, e.g. fir, fur, fern [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}] [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}n], or [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}n]. Working-class speakers often neutralise two of these checked vowels to a low back [v{\{}inverted{\}}] vowel, fir, fur, both pronounced as [fv{\{}inverted{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}] or as [fv{\{}inverted{\}}{\{}glottal stop, reversed{\}}]. The middle-class merger is often assumed to be an adaptation towards the UK's socially prestigious R.P. phonological system in which there is a long-standing three-way non-rhotic merger, to [e{\{}reversed, open{\}}:]. However, we suggest a system-internal cause, that coarticulation with the postvocalic /r/ may play a role in the contemporary Scottish vowel merger. Indeed, strongly rhotic middle-class Scottish speakers have recently been found to produce postvocalic approximant /r/ using a markedly different tongue configuration from working-class Scottish speakers, who also tend to derhoticise /r/. We present the results of an ultrasound tongue imaging investigation into the differing coarticulatory effects of bunched and tongue-front raised /r/ variants on preceding vowels. We compare tongue shapes from two static points during rhotic syllable rimes. Phonetically, it appears that the bunched /r/ used by middle-class speakers exerts a stronger global coarticulatory force over preceding vowel tongue configurations than tongue-front raised /r/ does. This also results in a monophthongal rhotic target for what historically had been three distinct checked vowels. Phonologically, our view is that middle-class speakers of Scottish English have reduced the V+/r/ sequence to one segment; either a rhoticised vowel /e{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}/ or a syllabic rhotic /r/. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The autocorrelation function, a measure of regularity in the speech signal, is applied in demarcating the seemingly diffuse intervals of glottalization which accompany or replace voiceless oral stops in elicited recordings from 22 young speakers of Southern British English. It is shown that a local minimum in autocorrelation characterizes almost all instances heard as intervocalic glottal stops; an annotation procedure is developed and used to gather data on glottalization gestures, including duration, f0, energy and autocorrelation. The same measure is used to assess regularity of vocal fold vibration in an interval just prior to the formation of the total closure for instances of syllable-final /t/, and confirms significantly lower autocorrelation in a group auditorily judged 'pre-glottalized'. Implications are considered both for normal speech perception and for expert phonetic judgments.},

abstract = {This study describes the frequencies of the first two formants of monophthongs produced by male RP speakers in four age groups: aged 20–25, 35–40, 50–55, and 65–73 years in 2001. The eleven monophthongs were spoken in /hVd/ contexts by five men in each age group. The eleven words, together with nineteen filler words chosen to distract attention from the purpose of the experiment, were randomized four times and read by each speaker in citation form, for a total of 880 items. F1 and F2 frequencies were measured in Hz and ERB-rate. As expected, in younger compared with older speakers, F1 is higher in /E/ and especially /oe/, and F2 is higher in /u{\ldots}/ and /U/. Other vowels varied in overall dispersion of F1 or F2, but no other differences between age groups were observed. There is evidence that the oldest age group to show change in a vowel's quality has particularly large differences between individuals, so that, collectively, members of that group span much of the quality range from 'conservative' (older groups) to 'progressive' (younger groups). Such so-called 'break groups' have implications for theoretical explanations of sound change.},

Results show that phonological and stylistic constraints play an important role in determining the realizational variation of /t/, as many similar studies have shown. However, there is also clear evidence that our understanding of this phenomenon has been restricted by the limited set of factors that have been investigated previously, as results show that this feature is also constrained by word frequency and morphophonological factors. These findings raise important questions concerning the role of morphological compositionality in language change and the nature of lexical diffusion.},

abstract = {In American English, the presence of creaky voice can derive from distinct linguistic processes, including phrasal creak (pro- longed irregular voicing, often at edges of prosodic phrases) and coda /t/ glottalization (when the alveolar closure for syllable- final /t/ is replaced by or produced simultaneously with glottal constriction). Previous work has shown that listeners can differ- entiate words in phrasal creak from those with /t/ glottalization, which suggests that there are acoustic differences between the creaky voice derived from phrasal creak and /t/ glottalization. In this study, we analyzed vowels preceding syllable-final /t/ in the Buckeye Corpus, which includes audio recordings of spon- taneous speech from 40 speakers of American English. Tokens were coded for presence of phrasal creak (prolonged irregular voicing extending beyond the target syllable) and /t/ glottaliza- tion (whether the /t/ was produced only with glottal constric- tion). Eleven spectral measures of voice quality, including both harmonic and noise measures, were extracted automatically and discriminant analyses were performed. The results indicate that the discriminant functions can classify these sources of creaky voice above chance, and that Cepstral Peak Prominence, a mea- sure of harmonics-to-noise ratio, is important for distinguishing phrasal creak from glottalization.},

@article{Savage2013,
abstract = {The social scientific analysis of social class is attracting renewed interest given the accentuation of economic and social inequalities throughout the world. The most widely validated measure of social class, the Nuffield class schema, developed in the 1970s, was codified in the UK's National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) and places people in one of seven main classes according to their occupation and employment status. This principally distinguishes between people working in routine or semi-routine occupations employed on a ‘labour contract' on the one hand, and those working in professional or managerial occupations employed on a ‘service contract' on the other. However, this occupationally based class schema does not effectively capture the role of social and cultural processes in generating class divisions. We analyse the largest survey of social class ever conducted in the UK, the BBC's 2011 Great British Class Survey, with 161,400 web respondents, as well as a nationally representative sample survey, which includes unusually detailed questions asked on social, cultural and economic capital. Using latent class analysis on these variables, we derive seven classes. We demonstrate the existence of an ‘elite', whose wealth separates them from an established middle class, as well as a class of technical experts and a class of ‘new affluent' workers. We also show that at the lower levels of the class structure, alongside an ageing traditional working class, there is a ‘precariat' characterised by very low levels of capital, and a group of emergent service workers. We think that this new seven class model recognises both social polarisation in British society and class fragmentation in its middle layers, and will attract enormous interest from a wide social scientific community in offering an up-to-date multi-dimensional model of social class.},

abstract = {This article evaluates a speaker-intrinsic vowel formant frequency normalization algorithm initially proposed in Watt {\&} Fabricius (2002). We compare how well this routine, known as the S-centroid procedure, performs as a sociophonetic research tool in three ways: reducing variance in area ratios of vowel spaces (by attempting to equalize vowel space areas); improving overlap of vowel polygons; and reproducing relative positions of vowel means within the vowel space, compared with formant data in raw Hertz. The Study uses existing data sets of vowel formant data from two varieties of English, Received Pronunciation and Aberdeen English (northeast Scotland). We conclude that. for the data examined here, the S-centroid W{\&}F procedure performs at least as well as the two speaker-intrinsic, vowel-extrinsic, formant-intrinsic normalization methods rated as best performing by Adank (2003): Lobanov's (1971) z-score procedure and Nearey's (1978) individual log-mean procedure (CLIHi4 in Adank [2003], CLIHi2 as tested here), and in some test cases better than the latter.},

The paper asks if Descartes's idea of an inner self can be upheld and discusses this issue by invoking two principles: the phenomenal transparency of experience and the semantic compositionality of conceptual content. It is assumed that self-awareness is a second-order state either in the domain of experience or in the domain of thought. In the former case self-awareness turns out empty if experience is transparent. In the latter, it can best be conceived of as a form of mental quotation. Various proposed analyses of direct and indirect quotation are discussed and tested regarding their applicability to thought. It is concluded that, on the assumption of compositionality, the inner self is only insofar accessible to awareness as it has an accessible phonological (or otherwise subsymbolic) structure, as apparently only inner speech does. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The aim of the study is to ascertain whether accent change affects individuals during their lifetimes or is only brought about by new generations of speakers accepting different pronunciations as the norm and effectively speaking with a different accent to older generations within their social circle. The variations/changes looked for were: CLOTH transfer, CURE lowering, GOAT allophony, R-sandhi, and T-voicing. The procedure of the study was to identify the presence or absence of these features in the speech of certain individuals in recordings made over a period of at least 35 years. The individuals studied were: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Baroness Thatcher, Sir David Attenborough and David Dimbleby. The results of these comparisons suggest that individual speakers are not greatly affected by changes in pronunciation taking place around them and generally stay with the preferred pronunciation of their youth. There are, however, cases where a general uncertainty amongst speakers of the accent, here found in CURE lowering, does influence the speech of individuals over time.},

abstract = {The accent described here is the present-day version of the accent that has been used as the standard in phoneticians' description of the pronunciation of British English for centuries. The definition of this accent is a matter of heated debate and frequent controversy: the arguments will not be rehearsed here, but the interested reader is recommended to look at Jones (1917 and subsequent) and Wells (2000). The most important aspects of this accent should, however, be made clear: a. The number of native speakers of this accent who originate in Ireland, Scotland and Wales is very small and probably diminishing, and it is therefore a misnomer to call it an accent of BRITISH English. It is an accent spoken by some English people. b. The great majority of native speakers of this accent are of middle-class or upper-class origin, educated at private schools and (if of appropriate age) university. This does not mean that the accent cannot be acquired by others: the present author (who attended a state school in the Midlands) originally spoke with an accent with noticeable regional features, but has over many years of teaching the phonetics of English acquired an accent not far from the standard one described here. c. The majority of speakers of this accent live in, or originate from, the south-east of England. d. The accent is most familiar as that used by most 'official' BBC speakers of English origin (newsreaders and announcers on Radio 4 and Radio 3, and most television channels). It is also frequently heard on the BBC World Service, though that service appears to have adopted the policy of sometimes using newsreaders and announcers with noticeable foreign accents. It is clear that this accent will eventually lose its pre-eminent status in broadcasting as a result of the wish to broaden the social base of broadcast speech, but it will take a long time for this to happen. The accent has been known for nearly a century as RECEIVED PRONUNCIATION, or by its abbreviation, RP. Early in the 20th century, Daniel Jones, the great exponent of the description of English pronunciation, named it PUBLIC SCHOOL PRONUNCIATION (Jones 1917), but later changed the name to Received Pronunciation. Other names have been proposed, such as GENERAL BRITISH (GB) and EDUCATED SOUTHERN BRITISH ENGLISH. The present author's own preference is for the name BBC PRONUNCIATION or BBC ACCENT (Jones, ed. by Roach et al. 2003), but given the continuing popularity of the name Received Pronunciation, this has been used for the description which follows.},

abstract = {A growing literature argues that native-speaker syntactic judgments are best tested with standard psycholinguistic protocols, but the difficulty of formal experimentation has prevented many syntacticians from trying it. Fortunately, as shown by textual analysis of a typical theoretical syntax paper (Li, 1998), syntacticians already recognize the value of proper experimental designs and quantitative analyses, albeit in nascent forms. Small-scale judgment experiments build on this foundation by applying the minimum amount of extra effort needed to draw valid statistical inferences from the type of data most familiar to syntacticians, namely binary judgments involving very few speakers and sentences. Statistical methods appropriate for such data, some hitherto underused, are described, and software tools for automating small-scale judgment experimentation are introduced. The simplicity and power of the methods are then illustrated in a small-scale test of the claims in Li (1998) on naive Chinese speakers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Glottal stops that occur in vowel-consonant-vowel context are often not realized as stops at all, but rather show voicing that is continuous throughout the glottal constriction gesture. Glottal articulations that are realized in this way are apparently marked by reductions in amplitude and fundamental frequency. In the present study measurements from naturally produced utterances containing the sequence /o?o/ (i.e., a glottal stop separating two identical vowels) were used to create a set of synthetic stimuli that varied in their F0 and amplitude contours. The utterances were resynthesized in six ways: (a) original pitch/original amplitude, (b) original pitch/flat amplitude, (c) flat pitch/original amplitude, (d) flat pitch/flat amplitude, (e) flat pitch/inverted amplitude, and (f) inverted pitch/flat amplitude. Results indicated that: (a) a dip in the pitch contour is nearly always sufficient to cue the presence of a glottal stop in the absence of any drop in amplitude, (b) a dip in the amplitude contour is usually sufficient to cue the presence of a glottal stop, and (c) signals with inverted contours were not heard as glottal stops, indicating that it is not merely an abrupt change that is needed to signal a glottal stop.},

abstract = {Speakers can adopt a speaking style that allows them to be understood more easily in difficult communication situations, but few studies have examined the acoustic properties of clearly produced consonants in detail. This study attempts to characterize the adaptations in the clear production of American English fricatives in a carefully controlled range of communication situations. Ten female and ten male talkers produced fricatives in vowel-fricative-vowel contexts in both a conversational and a clear style that was elicited by means of simulated recognition errors in feedback received from an interactive computer program. Acoustic measurements were taken for spectral, amplitudinal, and temporal properties known to influence fricative recognition. Results illustrate that (1) there were consistent overall style effects, several of which (consonant duration, spectral peak frequency, and spectral moments) were consistent with previous findings and a few (notably consonant-to-vowel intensity ratio) of which were not; (2) specific acoustic modifications in clear productions of fricatives were influenced by the nature of the recognition errors that prompted the productions and were consistent with efforts to emphasize potentially misperceived contrasts both within the English fricative inventory and based on feedback from the simulated listener; and (3) talkers differed widely in the types and magnitude of all modifications.},

abstract = {This paper presents three experiments that investigate the relationship between gradient and binary judgments of grammaticality. In the first two experiments, two different groups of participants judged sentences by the method of magnitude esti- mation and by the method of speeded grammaticality judgments in a single session. The two experiments involved identical sentence materials but they differed in the order in which the two procedures were applied. The results show a high correlation between the magnitude estimation data and the speeded grammaticality judgments data, both within a session and across the two sessions. The third experiment was a questionnaire study in which participants judged the same sentences as either gram- matical or ungrammatical without time pressure. This experiment yielded results quite similar to those of the other two experiments. Thus gradient and binary judg- ments both provide valuable and reliable sources for linguistic theory when assessed in an experimentally controlled way. We present a model based on Signal Detection Theory which specifies how gradient grammaticality scores are mapped to binary grammaticality judgments. Finally, we compare our experimental results to existing corpus data in order to inquire into the relationship between grammaticality and frequency of usage},

abstract = {In this paper we analyse the extent to which an adult's vowel space is affected by vowel changes to the community using a database of nine Christmas broadcasts made by Queen Elizabeth II spanning three time periods (the 1950's; the late 1960's/early 70's; the 1980's). An analysis of the monophthongal formant space showed that the first formant frequency was generally higher for open vowels, and lower for mid-high vowels in the 1960's and 1980's data than in the 1950's data, which we interpret as an expansion of phonetic height from earlier to later years. The second formant frequency showed a more modest compression in later, compared with earlier years: in general, front vowels had a decreased F2 in later years, while F2 of the back vowels was unchanged except for [u] which had a higher F2 in the 1960's and 1980's data. We also show that the majority of these Fl and F2 changes were in the direction of the vowel positions of 1980's Standard Southern British speakers reported in Deterding (1997). Our general conclusion is that there is evidence of accent change within the same individual over time and that the Queen's vowels in the Christmas broadcasts have shifted in the direction of a more mainstream form of Received Pronunciation.},

These procedures are being used to examine the sources of variability that exist in the acoustic characteristics of these consonants for different phonetic contexts, speakers, and speaking styles. There are three motivations for this work: (1) to improve models of articulatory-to-acoustic mapping; (2) to develop procedures and data that can be used in knowledge-based automatic speech recognition and in speech synthesis; and (3) to provide a baseline of the normal range of variation of these consonants, against which clinicians can evaluate disordered production. The data show that combining a variety of acoustic properties from the bursts and transitions for stop consonants leads to robust classification of place of articulation, particularly if the gender of the speaker and if the feature [back] in the adjacent vowel is known.},

This process is hypothesised to follow from the fragmentation of tight-knit urban communities that formed after large-scale immigration to Tyneside from elsewhere in the British Isles during the 18th and 19th centuries. High levels of dialect contact brought about by this influx are argued to have promoted the creation of an urban koin{\'{e}}, which in its contemporary form appears increasingly to be losing specifically local features. In addition to contact and mobility as agents of change, the history of unusually acute stigma attached to Tyneside speech should be considered. These and other social factors inform an analysis of the FACE and GOAT variables in the speech of 32 contemporary Tyneside English speakers of various ages, both sexes and from two social class groups.},

abstract = {The present study is concerned with lax /ʊ/-fronting in Standard British English and in particular with whether this sound change in progress can be attributed to a waning of the perceptual compensation for the coarticulatory effects of context. Younger and older speakers produced various monosyllables in which /ʊ/ occurred in different symmetrical consonantal contexts. The same speakers participated in a forced-choice perception experiment in which they categorized a synthetic /ɪ-ʊ/ continuum embedded in fronting /s{\_}t/ and non-fronting /w{\_}l/ contexts. /ʊ/ was shown to be fronted for the younger age group in both production and perception. Although there was no conclusive evidence that younger listeners compensated less for coarticulation than did older listeners, the size of the coarticulatory influence of consonantal context on /ʊ/ in perception was found to be smaller than in production for the younger than for the older group. The findings are consistent with a model of sound change in which the perceptual compensation for coarticulation wanes ahead of changes that take place to coarticulatory relationships in speech production. As a result, the perception and production of coarticulation may be unusually misaligned with respect to each other for some speaker-listeners participating in a sound change in progress. Keywords},

With particular reference to Silverstein's discussion of second-order indexicality, it argues that language varieties in Britain and the United States are differently ideologized in such a way as to foreground social class groups in Britain and ethnic groups in the United States. This difference gives rise to characteristically different kinds of national language controversy. American and British images of a spoken standard language are not only quite different but also occupy a pivotal position in their respective ideological systems. In America, a leveled variety is imagined as standard and mainstream, while in Britain an elite classmarked variety is commonly imagined as standard. Each type of standard, while imagined as a neutral reference point, sets up a pattern of structural oppositions that foregrounds and stigmatizes the codes indexing "nonmainstream" groups in the United States and "lower-class" groups in Britain.},

abstract = {Splittable compounds (SCs) are verbal constructions in Chinese that consist of two parts which are separable by some interposing elements, though they behave like and are usually considered as single words when they are not separated. For many years, SCs in Chinese have presented a challenge to existing morphological and syntactic theories for their morpho-syntactic status. The present study takes a corpus-based approach to the SCs in their interaction with morphology, syntax, and pragmatics, aiming at producing a systematic and realistic account of SCs as attested in 2 million words of authentic spoken and written Chinese data. The results show that the typical grammatical pattern of SCs is constitutive of an aspect marker (-le, -zhe, -guo) or resultative verb complements as post-verbal adjacent elements (54{\%} of all SCs), and a quantifier, a classifier, a modifier or a combination of two or more of them which precede the nominal components of SCs. Drawing on morpho-syntactic and phonological criteria, the split uses, together with their combined uses, of SCs with one inserted aspectual morpheme are viewed as words, while the others are regarded as phrases. From a discourse-pragmatic perspective, the split use of SCs is more often found in the spoken genres of Chinese. Insertions of SCs tend to function as mitigation or modification to the verbal heads or final nominal/complement elements. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite the prominence of socioeconomic status as a factor in models of English variation, few studies have explicitly considered speakers whose social class status changed over their lifetime. This paper presents an auditory and acoustic analysis of variation in non-prevocalic /r/ among middle-aged adults from Edinburgh, Scotland. The speakers represent three groups: the Established Middle Class (EMC) and the Working Class (WC), both of which are characterized as socioeconomically non-mobile, and a third group we call the New Middle Class (NMC), comprising individuals born to working-class families and living middle-class lives at the time of data collection. The results demonstrate that realizations of /r/ have a significant correlation with socioeconomic status, and that the effect of class further interacts with gender. NMC speakers demonstrate the highest level of rhoticity of all three groups. In contrast, WC men show extensive derhoticization and deletion, while WC women show patterns of rhoticity that are more comparable to the NMC women. The EMC speakers show more non-rhoticity than either the NMC speakers or the WC women. A consideration of the indexical value of weak rhoticity highlights the need for more robust phonetic measures distinguishing non-rhoticity from derhoticization, and to that end we consider the cue of post-vocalic frication. Overall, the results point to the need to conceptualize socioeconomic status as potentially fluid and changeable across the lifespan, thereby improving models of the relationship between social class and linguistic variation.},

abstract = {For a century, phoneticians have noted a vowel merger in middle-class Scottish English, in the neutralisation of prerhotic checked vowels /I{\{}small{\}}/, /v{\{}inverted{\}}/, /e{\{}open{\}}/ to a central vowel, e.g. fir, fur, fern [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}] [fe{\{}schwa{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}n], or [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}], [fe{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}n]. Working-class speakers often neutralise two of these checked vowels to a low back [v{\{}inverted{\}}] vowel, fir, fur, both pronounced as [fv{\{}inverted{\}}r{\{}turned{\}}] or as [fv{\{}inverted{\}}{\{}glottal stop, reversed{\}}]. The middle-class merger is often assumed to be an adaptation towards the UK's socially prestigious R.P. phonological system in which there is a long-standing three-way non-rhotic merger, to [e{\{}reversed, open{\}}:]. However, we suggest a system-internal cause, that coarticulation with the postvocalic /r/ may play a role in the contemporary Scottish vowel merger. Indeed, strongly rhotic middle-class Scottish speakers have recently been found to produce postvocalic approximant /r/ using a markedly different tongue configuration from working-class Scottish speakers, who also tend to derhoticise /r/. We present the results of an ultrasound tongue imaging investigation into the differing coarticulatory effects of bunched and tongue-front raised /r/ variants on preceding vowels. We compare tongue shapes from two static points during rhotic syllable rimes. Phonetically, it appears that the bunched /r/ used by middle-class speakers exerts a stronger global coarticulatory force over preceding vowel tongue configurations than tongue-front raised /r/ does. This also results in a monophthongal rhotic target for what historically had been three distinct checked vowels. Phonologically, our view is that middle-class speakers of Scottish English have reduced the V+/r/ sequence to one segment; either a rhoticised vowel /e{\{}schwa, right hook{\}}/ or a syllabic rhotic /r/. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the principal findings of a recent project carried out on phonological variation and change in contemporary spoken English. We examined patterns of phonological variation and change in contemporary urban dialects using quantitative sociolinguistic methods, instrumental phonetic and phonological analysis. Conversational and word-list data were systematically collected from 32 Tyneside and 32 Derby speakers, each sample being stratified to include equal numbers of men and women, two age-groups and two social class groups. This sample design allowed us to assess the impact of age, class, and gender on patterns of language variation and change, as well as the geographical domains of specific changes. The principal results are described and their theoretical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {The study aims to enrich the available acoustic data pertaining to vowels of what may tentatively be called contemporary RP or near-RP. The corpus comprised BBC radio and TV broadcasts of seven male and seven female newsreaders. F1 and F2 measurements of 11 monophthongs ( kit, dress, trap, foot, strut, lot, fleece, palm, goose, thought and nurse ) and 4 diphthongs ( goat, price, mouth and face ) were taken. The results are presented both as raw mean F1 and F2 frequencies in Hertz and on a plot normalised according to Lobanov (1971). The results, among other things, confirm our hypothesis that the onset of mouth is now decidedly fronter than and does not overlap with the onset of price. Furthermore, we sought to determine the exact extent of goose- fronting, which according to our data is, even in this variety of English, fronter than centre, as well as the quality of the goat glide, which seems to be following suit.},
