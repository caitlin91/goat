Syllable is smallest constituent of the prosodic hierarchy.
Foot is the next one up, one or more syllables.
Maximal onset principle-an intervocalic consonant will be placed at the beginning of the syllable to its right rather than the end of the syllable to its left.
Q - does English really not syllabify acfross words. Cat on the mat -{\textgreater} ca.ton? Came up in my word lists - unstressed following syllable.},

abstract = {Using the metrical structure proposed by M. Liberman {\&} A. Prince (see LLBA 12/I, 7800555), it is argued that the assignment of metrical structure is cyclic {\&} that there can be no deforestation. The proposed cyclicity changes permit Liberman's {\&} Prince's stress rules to cover certain regularities of English stress which were originally unaccounted for or handled in terms of the "metrical grid." Assuming that subsyllabic metrical structure is also assigned in cyclic fashion, {\&} recognizing the foot as a domain of segmental processes eliminates the necessity for ambisyllabicity in English phonology. 38 Figures.

hierarcy of syllable then foot
metrical structure is reassigned cyclically --{\textgreater} resyllabification on word level {\&} postcyclically - works against ambisyllabicity
